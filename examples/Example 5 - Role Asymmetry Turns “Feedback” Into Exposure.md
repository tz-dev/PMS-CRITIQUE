## Example 5 — *Role Asymmetry Turns “Feedback” Into Exposure*

**(Judgment Drift Under Asymmetry)**

**Case label:** *Evaluative Correction Without Coordination*
**Scale:** b–c) Small group / institutional training setting
**Overlay:** No publicness overlay (P inactive; exposure is local but role-amplified)
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No claims about intent, competence, or character. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**
Live training or evaluation session with hierarchical role differentiation.

* **□ (Frame anchor):**
  Training / evaluation frame: correction is expected, authority to speak is asymmetrically assigned.

* **Ω (Asymmetry):**
  Senior role bears low exposure cost; junior role bears high reputational and participation cost.

* **Θ (Temporality):**
  The episode leaves residue: memory, reputation, and anticipatory self-restraint in later sessions.

**Trigger (Δ / ∇):**

* **Δ (Difference):**
  A deviation from an expected standard becomes visible.
* **∇ (Impulse):**
  Pressure to correct immediately and publicly within the evaluative frame.

**Non-event candidates (Λ):**

* Private or delayed correction.
* Specification of a concrete corrective step.
* Explicit closure that restores participation safety.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* Correction is delivered publicly.
* Language generalizes (“this kind of mistake,” “you need to be more careful”).
* No actionable next step is integrated beyond evaluative labeling.

### B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Readability Aid)

* **□ (Frame – evaluative):**
  Defines correction as assessment rather than coordination.

* **Ω (Asymmetry – exposure gradient):**
  Visibility and cost concentrate on the junior role.

* **Δ (Difference – legible mismatch):**
  A real deviation from standard exists and is named.

* **Σ (Integration – absent):**
  No coherent corrective action is synthesized.

* **Θ (Temporality – reputational persistence):**
  The event narrows future participation through remembered exposure.

* **Α (Attractor – script stabilization):**
  “Do not ask / do not risk” stabilizes as a participation script.

---

### C. Drift Classification

**Drift class:** Judgment masquerading as critique

**Minimal drift signature:**
**Δ present + □ evaluative + Ω high / Σ absent**

**Observable drift markers (non-moral):**

* Evaluation substitutes for coordination.
* Exposure rises while actionability collapses.

---

### D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects)

* **Ω (Asymmetry):**
  The cost of being wrong is borne unevenly; silence becomes cheaper than participation.

* **Θ (Temporality):**
  A single episode influences future behavior through anticipatory restraint.

* **Α (Script narrowing):**
  Reduced questioning and experimentation normalize over time.

* **Λ (Non-event load):**
  Absence of repair or follow-up signals that exposure is the default consequence.

---

### E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Within this configuration, the following responses are **structurally rational**:

* Increased risk-avoidance by the junior role.
* Reduced question-asking by peers who observe exposure costs.
* Compliance without engagement, as participation becomes hazardous.

These responses follow from **Ω across Θ with missing Σ**, not from lack of motivation or resilience.

---

### F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)

**Risk point:**
Dignity-in-practice is strained when correction increases exposure without restoring agency.

**Structural indicator:**
The frame permits correction but does not protect recoverability or participation safety.

---

### G. Reader Guard / Validity Gate

This example **does not claim**:

* that public feedback is inherently wrong,
* that hierarchy is illegitimate,
* that the senior acted maliciously,
* that the mistake should not be addressed.

It **does claim**:

* that critique mutates into judgment when exposure dominates coordination,
* that integration is required for correction to remain viable,
* that asymmetry shapes participation independently of intent.

Any use of this example for shaming, ranking, or instruction violates PMS validity conditions (**Χ, reversibility, D**).

---

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

In this configuration, critique fails not because a standard is named, but because correction is not integrated. The evaluative frame amplifies asymmetry, converting difference into exposure rather than coordination. Over time, participation adapts rationally: silence and risk-avoidance become stable responses. The drift stabilizes where **Ω overwhelms Σ across Θ**, allowing judgment to masquerade as critique without producing correction.
