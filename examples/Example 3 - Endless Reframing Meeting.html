			<h1><strong>PMS-CRITIQUE</strong></h1>
			<h2><em>Example 3: Endless Reframing Meeting</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Explanatory Expansion vs. Missing Consolidation</em>
			<strong>Scale:</strong> c) Institutional / small-group
			<strong>Overlay:</strong> No publicness overlay (P inactive)
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No evaluation of competence, intent, or sincerity. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>
			Recurring policy or operations meeting within an organization.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame anchor):</strong>
			Formal meeting frame with agenda, turn-taking, and distributed decision authority.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Monthly or bi-weekly recurrence over several months; no terminal decision point.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (structural, not personal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁…Rₙ: domain representatives contributing explanations.</li>
			<li>No single role holds clear integration or enactment authority.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ / ∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong>
			Recurrent mismatch between intended process outcome and observed failure.</li>
			<li><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong>
			Pressure to “make sense of it” and demonstrate analytical responsiveness.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Expected but missing events (Λ candidates):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A bounded corrective proposal that survives beyond one meeting.</li>
			<li>A decision that binds follow-up responsibility across time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Each meeting introduces additional contextual layers.</li>
			<li>Explanations multiply (“budget,” “culture,” “vendor,” “legal constraint”).</li>
			<li>Participants report improved understanding.</li>
			<li>The operational failure continues unchanged.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Readability Aid)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Δ (Difference – mismatch recognized):</strong>
			The process failure remains legible and repeatedly acknowledged.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame – meeting structure):</strong>
			Defines who may speak and what counts as relevant explanation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Φ (Recontextualization – frame expansion):</strong>
			The situation is repeatedly embedded in new explanatory contexts.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Σ (Integration – consolidation):</strong>
			Remains absent or too weak to synthesize explanations into a corrective step.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality – accumulation):</strong>
			Each cycle adds interpretive weight while leaving the outcome unchanged.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Attractor – stabilization):</strong>
			“Reframe again next meeting” hardens into the default coordination script.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Dependency hygiene note:</strong>
			Any reference to <strong>Χ (Distance)</strong> in this configuration functions as a reduced marker. In PMS terms, <strong>Χ presupposes Φ (Recontextualization) and Θ (Temporality)</strong> within a <strong>□ (Frame)</strong> background; here, distance is verbally invoked but structurally uncoupled from integration.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Drift Classification</h3>
			<p><strong>Drift class:</strong> Narrative repair masquerading as critique</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal drift signature:</strong>
			<strong>Φ present / Σ absent or underpowered</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Observable drift markers (non-moral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Narrative density increases while corrective coordination remains unreachable.</li>
			<li>Reframing becomes the endpoint rather than a bridge to action.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Repetition converts non-resolution into a normalized trajectory.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Script narrowing):</strong>
			Meetings stabilize as explanatory forums rather than decision sites.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry):</strong>
			Responsibility for integration diffuses across roles; exposure for non-action remains low.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Λ (Non-event load):</strong>
			Absence of binding decisions accumulates interpretive pressure and latent frustration.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following behaviors are <strong>structurally rational</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Continuing to add context to demonstrate engagement and competence.</li>
			<li>Avoiding integration steps that would concentrate accountability.</li>
			<li>Interpreting “better understanding” as progress in the absence of correction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These responses follow from <strong>Φ under weak Σ across Θ</strong>, not from resistance to change.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>
			Dignity-in-practice erodes when analytical contribution substitutes for enacted coordination, and unresolved load is silently redistributed.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>
			No one is degraded, but responsibility remains structurally unowned, allowing failure to persist without violation.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader Guard / Validity Gate</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that reframing is evasive or dishonest,</li>
			<li>that participants lack insight or goodwill,</li>
			<li>that explanation is inferior to action,</li>
			<li>that someone “should have decided.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that recontextualization alone does not produce correction,</li>
			<li>that understanding can increase while viability decreases,</li>
			<li>that critique can mutate into narrative repair when integration remains structurally unavailable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any use of this analysis for blame or instruction violates PMS validity conditions (<strong>Χ, reversibility, D</strong>).</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>In this configuration, critique pressure is continuously absorbed by recontextualization. Each new frame reduces local tension but postpones consolidation. Over time, explanation becomes the stable output, while correction remains structurally unreachable. What persists is not confusion, but a polished understanding that never binds. The drift does not arise from analytical weakness—it emerges from <strong>Φ operating without Σ across Θ</strong>, until “talking about the problem” replaces changing it.</p>
