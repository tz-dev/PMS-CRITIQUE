### Operator Orientation (PMS_1.1, critique lens)

This paper uses the eleven PMS meta-axioms (Δ–Ψ) as a fixed operator set.  
The table below provides a **functional orientation** for how each operator appears *in critique-related configurations*.  
It is not a re-definition of PMS and does not replace the full PMS specification.

| Symbol | Operator | Core function (general) | Function in PMS-CRITIQUE (scene-bound) | Depends on |
|:----:|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| Δ | Difference | Enables minimal distinction | A mismatch becomes legible as “something is off” | — |
| ∇ | Impulse | Directional activation | Pressure to react, respond, or correct emerges | Δ |
| □ | Frame | Structures relevance and roles | Defines *what would count* as a response or correction | Δ, ∇ |
| Λ | Non-Event | Meaningful absence under expectation | Absence of critique becomes consequential and load-bearing | □ |
| Α | Attractor | Stabilized repetition | Recurrent critique or non-critique scripts harden over time | Δ, ∇, □, Λ |
| Ω | Asymmetry | Directional imbalance | Exposure, power, and cost gradients shape who can critique whom | Α |
| Θ | Temporality | Trajectories and accumulation | Delays, irreversibility, and follow-up windows determine viability | Ω, Α |
| Φ | Recontextualization | Frame transformation | Makes critique bearable and actionable rather than merely oppositional | Θ, Ω, □ |
| Χ | Distance | Reflective interruption | Enables critique as interruption rather than reaction or judgment | Φ, Θ, □ |
| Σ | Integration | Coherent synthesis | Turns interruption into a corrective step instead of commentary | Χ, Φ |
| Ψ | Self-Binding | Commitment across time | Binds critique to follow-up, accountability, and trajectory ownership | Σ, Θ, Χ |

*Reading note:*  
Operators are used **compositionally**. Breaks, substitutions, or overloads in these chains explain critique drift, diffusion, escalation, or paralysis without invoking motives, traits, or moral rankings.

### 0.1 Purpose & Object

PMS-CRITIQUE treats critique as a praxeological operation rather than as a moral attitude, a psychological trait, or a truth-claim by itself. The object of the paper is the structure of critique episodes as they occur in situated practice: a mismatch becomes legible, an interruption becomes possible, the situation is re-framed, a coherent correction becomes reachable, and (optionally) follow-up becomes bound into a trajectory. This object is deliberately defined as an operatoric grammar of enactment: the paper tracks how critique arises, how it fails to arise, and how it mutates into recognizable drifts such as escalation, ridicule, paralysis, diffusion, or pillory dynamics.

The aim is to render the operator grammar visible in a way that remains scene-bound and non-personal: which constellations produce critique as correction, which produce merely reaction, which stabilize silence, which generate “commentary without correction,” and which structures make critique drift-prone at scale. The paper therefore treats critique as a chain that can break at specific structural points, rather than as a question of “good will” or “bad character.” It also treats non-critique not as “nothing” but as a stable path that can accumulate costs over time and can become script-like in groups and publics.

The non-aims are strict and central to the paper’s validity. PMS-CRITIQUE is not life advice, not a guide for “how to critique,” not a normative education program, and not a ranking mechanism for people, groups, or institutions. It is not a clinical tool and does not provide therapeutic interpretation. It does not diagnose motives, competence, intelligence, pathology, or “maturity,” and it does not claim authority over a person’s inner life. It also does not serve as a rhetorical shield for anyone: the paper does not provide moral exculpation through structural description, and it does not provide moral condemnation through structural labeling. It offers a grammar for describing what happens in critique scenes, how costs arise, and why certain drifts are predictable under specific loads.

### 0.2 PMS Entry Condition (Gating)

PMS-CRITIQUE is valid as a PMS application only if the following conditions are consistently upheld throughout the text. These conditions bind the paper as an application of PMS; they do not bind critique or rejection of PMS itself.

**Χ (Distance).** The paper must maintain a meta-position and a stop-capability in its own writing. Distance here is not politeness and not “niceness.” It is the structural ability to interrupt impulse-driven enactment and to avoid fusion with the object of critique. In practice terms: the paper must not substitute justificatory rhetoric for structure, must not write as if outrage or certainty were the same as critique, and must not convert description into a rhetorical weapon. In textual terms: the paper must preserve a reflective stance that keeps claims revisable, scene-bound, and non-personal, and it must keep critique analyzable as a configuration rather than enacted as a performance inside the paper.

**Reversibility.** Interpretations must remain revisable and must not fix persons or groups globally. Reversibility is a reading rule, not a consequence reset. Structural explanation after the fact does not retroactively create distance in the original enactment, and it does not retroactively repair costs that already accumulated under temporality. Reversibility therefore means: the paper’s claims are framed as configuration statements that can be re-assigned if operator readings change, while acknowledging that real-world consequences under temporal accumulation remain real and cannot be erased by better interpretation.

**D (Dignity-in-Practice).** The paper must preserve restraint and respect in asymmetry and must refuse shaming and pillory logic as a mode of critique. D is not an ontological ranking and not a metaphysical claim; it is a practice condition that limits what critique is allowed to do as an enactment under asymmetry. In particular: D never justifies humiliation, even when critique content is “correct,” even when the target is unpopular, and even when an audience rewards degradation. The paper must therefore describe pillory dynamics as drift forms and must not reproduce them as rhetorical technique.

**Application vs. critique.** These conditions apply to PMS-CRITIQUE as an application. Critique of PMS, rejection of PMS, or non-use of PMS remains unrestricted. The gating therefore functions as a validity constraint for the paper’s own method, not as an attempt to regulate discourse outside the paper.

### 0.3 Method Mode: Structure Instead of Inner States

PMS-CRITIQUE operates in a structural mode. The object of analysis is not “what people feel” but what configurations do: roles, frames, cost layouts, scripts, stabilization paths, review windows, exposure gradients, and publicity dynamics. The paper treats critique as a praxeological chain that becomes possible under specific structural conditions and becomes drift-prone under identifiable loads. It therefore models how interruption, re-framing, integration, and follow-up arise or fail as elements of practice grammar, not as consequences of personality.

Accordingly, the paper rejects inner causality as an explanatory shortcut. It does not infer motives, traits, trauma, intelligence, deficits, or moral qualities. It does not diagnose “why someone is like that.” It describes what is structurally present in the scene and what stabilizes over time. When the paper uses words that are commonly psychologized (for example “outrage,” “cynicism,” “paralysis”), these are treated as names for configuration outcomes and stabilization forms, not as claims about inner states.

The evidence mode is work-immanent and generative. The paper derives claims from PMS operator dependencies and constellation logic. It does not use empirical data as justificatory anchor for the operator grammar. Where illustrative scenes are used elsewhere in the overall PMS ecosystem, they function as test vectors rather than as empirical claims; in this paper, the paper itself will not contain example vignettes and will not refer the reader to them. The repository may contain separate examples, but the paper remains self-contained as a structural grammar.

### 0.4 Scene Binding & Language Level

PMS-CRITIQUE enforces a global guard: no person labels. Every statement in the paper is bound to a praxeological scene or configuration and must specify, at least implicitly, the relevant role-space, frame conditions, timing, and degree of publicity. The preferred language is “in this configuration …” or “in this scene …” rather than “X is …” or “they are …”. This is not cosmetic; it is how the paper preserves reversibility and avoids converting structural description into personal fixation.

Statements are therefore constrained to roles, frames, and trajectories. The paper is permitted to use structural markers such as drift, risk, and viability, but only as constellation statements: drift is named as a mutation of the critique chain under specific operator load, not as a property of persons; risk is named as drift sensitivity under specific modulators, not as a moral suspicion; viability is named as a corridor in which the chain remains governable, not as a ranking of worth or character.

### 0.5 Core Thesis (Operatorial)

The core thesis is a re-positioning of what critique is structurally. Critique is not primarily truth, not primarily morality, and not primarily opposition. Truth-claims and moral claims may be present in critique scenes, but PMS-CRITIQUE treats them as content layers that are carried by a deeper practice grammar. The decisive structural question is whether a mismatch becomes interruptible, re-frameable, integrable, and follow-up capable under time and asymmetry.

In PMS terms, critique begins as a structural interruption: distance becomes available in response to a framed difference. Critique becomes productive only if it can be recontextualized in a way that renders the mismatch bearable and actionable, and if it can be integrated into a coherent corrective step rather than remaining at the level of commentary or judgment. Critique becomes stable only if some form of binding exists across time: follow-up, accountability, review, and repair require temporal extension and, at higher reach, self-binding. Without these, critique episodes may occur as momentary performances but will not consolidate into correction trajectories.

This thesis also implies a negative claim: many phenomena commonly called critique are structurally different. Reaction, judgment, shaming, outrage performance, and paralysis may co-occur with the same content, but they are not critique in the strict praxeological sense if the interruption, re-framing, integration, and follow-up chain does not become reachable.

### 0.6 Conceptual Discipline (Operational Definitions)

**Critique.** Critique is defined as a structure that stabilizes distance in response to a framed difference and can yield integrated corrective action under time and asymmetry. The minimal condition is that a mismatch becomes legible inside a frame and can be interrupted from a meta-position. The productive condition is that the interruption can be recontextualized and integrated into a coherent corrective step, and the stability condition is that follow-up can be bound into a trajectory.

**Drift.** Drift is defined as a stabilized deviation of the critique chain. Drift is not “a bad intention” and not “bad people.” Drift names the way operator sequences mutate under load: reaction replaces interruption, narrative repair replaces integration, power replaces coordination, silence replaces action, or amplification and irreversibility collapse restraint. Drift stabilizes via attractor formation under non-events, asymmetry, and temporality, meaning that it becomes easier to repeat than to correct.

**Responsibility diffusion.** Responsibility diffusion is defined as a group or public configuration where asymmetry gradients and non-events prevent critique from becoming integrated action or binding. This does not presuppose weakness, cowardice, or malice. It describes a structural situation in which role-space is unclear, costs are shifted, review windows are absent or compressed, and repeated non-intervention stabilizes into scripts. Diffusion is treated as a predictable stabilization form, not as a psychological verdict.

These definitions are operational discipline devices: they specify what counts as critique, what counts as drift, and what counts as diffusion in the operator grammar, and they prevent the paper from sliding into moralism, psychologization, or person fixation.

### 0.7 Output Form (Chapter Standard)

PMS-CRITIQUE follows a fixed chapter output standard to keep the text both generative and readable. Each chapter is written as a sequence of functional blocks: setup (what configuration is in view), mechanism (how the operator chain works here), differentiation (what it is and is not, structurally), drift and viability (how the chain mutates and where it remains governable), and a reader-facing closure.

Each chapter ends with a reader-facing section titled **Chapter-Closure**. The closure is not an operator recap and not a formula dump. It is a low-operator-density condensation that states the structural result, makes cost distribution visible, describes a viability corridor, and includes the entry-guard trace in a short, repeatable way. This repeated closure structure is treated as a stability device for the paper: it prevents the chapters from becoming technical demonstrations detached from readable consequences.

The closure also functions as a compliance checksum for the paper’s own method. It reminds the reader, without moralizing, that the paper is scene-bound, reversible in interpretation, and restrained in asymmetry.

### 0.8 Misreading Guards (Meta-Protection)

PMS-CRITIQUE includes explicit misreading guards because critique is meta-sensitive and drift-prone as a topic. First, structural understanding is not endorsement. Describing the grammar of critique does not endorse any specific critique content, and describing drift does not endorse drift as acceptable. Second, description is not exculpation. Structural explanation can clarify why an episode drifted, but it does not automatically justify what happened, and it does not suspend accountability in configurations where agency and stop-capacity were available.

Third, critique without moralism is a structural stance: critique is routed through costs, viability, and operator reach rather than through shaming. This is not an aesthetic preference; it is the condition under which critique can remain critique instead of mutating into degradation. Fourth, the paper includes an anti-instrumentalization guard: PMS-CRITIQUE must not be used as a delegitimization device that neutralizes critique by over-describing structure. “It’s just structure” is treated as a misuse when it functions to suspend accountability, to block correction, or to deny real cost layouts.

Fifth, the paper includes a no-retroactive-closure guard: structural explanation after the fact does not retroactively secure distance or dignity in the original scene. The paper therefore refuses a common misuse of meta-analysis: the idea that better understanding later cancels harm earlier. Interpretations remain revisable; consequences under temporality remain real.

### 0.9 Docking Points (Optional, Separation Rule)

PMS-CRITIQUE can optionally dock to MIP (Maturity in Practice) when the question is not how critique operates but whether critique is legitimate, attributable, or regime-relevant under complex asymmetry and publicity conditions. The docking is explicitly optional and is governed by a separation rule: PMS-CRITIQUE remains operatorial and descriptive; MIP remains evaluative and regime-focused. The paper must not mix these layers.

The separation rule has two functions. It prevents PMS-CRITIQUE from becoming a legitimacy court and thereby sliding into moralism or person evaluation. It also prevents MIP from becoming a substitute for the operator grammar, which would turn evaluative categories into pseudo-explanations. In practice terms: PMS-CRITIQUE can explain how interruption mutates into pillory under amplification; MIP can evaluate legitimacy and attribution in that regime. Letting one replace the other creates category errors and is treated as a misreading risk that the paper actively blocks.

## 1. Critique as an Unavoidable Praxis Tension (Δ–Λ axis)

### 1.1 Thesis (Assertion Without Morality)

This chapter establishes critique as a structural consequence of framed expectation rather than as a moral initiative or discretionary act. Wherever a frame renders certain responses, actions, or corrections expectable, the possibility of absence is already installed. That absence is not empty; it becomes legible and consequential within the frame. Critique therefore does not arise primarily from opposition or conviction, but from the tension between what is structurally expected and what actually occurs.

In this sense, critique is one possible stabilization path among others. It is neither guaranteed nor privileged by default. The same tension can stabilize into reaction, silence, ridicule, deferral, or diffusion, depending on how the configuration handles the pressure generated by expectation. The decisive point is that expectation makes non-occurrence meaningful, and meaning generates praxeological pressure that demands handling in some form.

### 1.2 Minimal Formula (Operatorial)

The minimal operator sequence that establishes critique as a structural possibility is:

Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ

A difference becomes perceptible, this difference activates directional tension, the frame structures that tension into relevance, and the absence of an expected response becomes a structured non-event. This sequence does not yet produce critique. It produces the condition under which critique, non-critique, or drift can emerge as stabilizations of the same tension.

### 1.3 Why “Not Criticizing” Is Also Praxis

Non-critique is not a neutral baseline. When an expected interruption or correction does not occur, the non-event itself becomes part of the praxis field. Silence, deferral, joking, or withdrawal are not absences of structure but structured responses to the same tension that could have produced critique.

Repeated non-critique stabilizes into recognizable scripts. Over time, these scripts narrow future options by making certain responses predictable and others increasingly costly. What begins as a momentary omission can therefore accumulate into a durable pattern that shapes roles, expectations, and exposure gradients within the configuration. In this way, “not criticizing” is itself a form of praxis that carries trajectory effects.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes critique as a structural possibility that arises wherever framed expectations render absence meaningful. The decisive point is that critique does not begin with moral intent, but with the tension produced when an expected response fails to occur. Once a frame installs relevance, non-occurrence becomes legible and generates pressure that must be handled. Critique is one possible stabilization of this pressure, but it is not the only one. Silence, deferral, or reaction emerge from the same structural condition. Non-critique is therefore not outside praxis; it is a distinct praxeological path that stabilizes under repetition.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** repeated non-critique accumulates over time, turning momentary omissions into durable trajectories that are increasingly costly to reverse.
- **Λ (non-event load):** absence under expectation generates interpretive pressure that does not dissipate on its own and tends to seek stabilization.
- **Α (script costs):** recurring non-critique stabilizes scripts such as avoidance or ridicule, narrowing future response options and increasing inertia.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** where asymmetry is present, costs of non-critique distribute unevenly, often externalizing burden toward less protected positions.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Structurally viable configurations acknowledge that expectation makes non-events consequential and provide ways to handle this tension without defaulting to silence or escalation. Drift begins where absence is treated as neutral, where accumulated non-events replace explicit handling, or where stabilized scripts substitute for interruption and clarification. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** maintained by treating critique and non-critique as structural paths rather than as personal virtues or failures.
- **Reversibility:** interpretations remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by describing costs and trajectories without shaming or ranking actors.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Critique remains governable where configurations recognize non-critique as an active stabilization with costs and address it structurally. Instability arises where absence is misread as neutrality or where repeated non-events harden into scripts that foreclose interruption. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Where frames create expectation, absence becomes structure: critique and non-critique are competing stabilizations of the same praxeological tension.

---

## 2. Minimal Critique: χ-Stabilization (core definition)

### 2.1 Thesis

This chapter establishes a strict structural minimum for what counts as critique in PMS-CRITIQUE. Critique, in the praxeological sense used here, requires **Χ (Distance)**. Without distance, a configuration may still produce strong responses, evaluations, or withdrawal, but it does not produce critique. Reaction, judgment, escalation, and paralysis are therefore not weaker forms of critique; they are structurally different outcomes.

The decisive clarification is that distance is not a matter of tone, politeness, or interpersonal softness. Χ (Distance) names interruptability and meta-position under pressure. It is the structural capacity to suspend immediate impulse long enough for a mismatch to be handled as a problem of coordination rather than as a trigger for discharge or avoidance. Where this capacity is absent, the system cannot interrupt itself, and critique as such cannot occur, regardless of how justified, accurate, or intense the content may be.

Minimal critique is therefore defined negatively as much as positively. It is not defined by courage, truthfulness, or moral resolve, but by the presence of an interruptible configuration in which a mismatch can be held at a distance from immediate enactment. This minimum does not yet guarantee correction, learning, or improvement. It merely establishes the condition under which critique becomes possible at all.

### 2.2 Minimal Formula (PMS-strict)

The minimal operator composition that defines critique in the strict sense is:

```

CRITIQUE_min := Χ ∘ (□ ∘ Δ)

```

A difference (Δ) becomes legible as a mismatch, the frame (□) renders this mismatch relevant within a practice grammar, and distance (Χ) enables interruption from immediate impulse.

This expression is a **reduced signature**, not a denial of operator dependencies. In PMS terms, **Χ (Distance) presupposes Φ (Recontextualization), Θ (Temporality), and □ (Frame)**. These prerequisites are structurally implicit in the configuration and are not claimed to be absent or bypassed. The formula marks the **threshold at which critique becomes structurally possible**, not a claim that distance can exist independently of its generative background.

The composition is intentionally minimal. It does not include integration (Σ), recontextualization (Φ), or self-binding (Ψ). It therefore marks a threshold, not an achievement: the point at which critique becomes possible, but not yet productive, corrective, or trajectory-shaping.

### 2.3 What Critique Is Not (Operatorial Differentiations)

This minimum allows clear structural differentiations that prevent category confusion.

Where impulse (∇) is activated without distance (Χ), the configuration produces reaction or escalation. Energy is discharged directly, and interruption does not occur. Where a frame (□) operates without a legible difference (Δ), the result is frame policing: enforcement of norms without contact to an actual mismatch. Where a difference is perceived without a frame, irritation remains diffuse and cannot be oriented toward a handleable target. Where distance appears without a stabilizing frame, detachment becomes unmoored and risks hardening into cynicism, irony, or withdrawal.

These are not failures of character, intention, or awareness. They are predictable outcomes of configurations in which the χ-condition is missing, misplaced, or unsupported by its structural background. Naming them as non-critique is therefore a structural clarification, not a moral downgrade.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes the strict minimum for critique as χ-stabilized framed differentiation. The decisive point is that critique requires distance as interruptability, not as politeness or restraint of expression. Without distance, responses may still occur, but they take the form of reaction, judgment, or paralysis rather than critique. Minimal critique marks a threshold condition: a mismatch can be held apart from immediate enactment and treated as a coordination problem. This minimum does not yet imply correction or learning; it only makes them structurally possible.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (Temporality):** repeated absence of distance accumulates into trajectories of reactivity or withdrawal that become harder to interrupt over time.
- **Λ (Non-event load):** where interruption is expected but does not occur, absence itself becomes pressure-bearing and seeks stabilization.
- **Α (Script costs):** configurations without Χ (Distance) tend to stabilize scripts of escalation, cynicism, or silence, narrowing future response options.
- **Ω (Asymmetry):** in asymmetric settings, lack of distance shifts costs unevenly, often amplifying exposure at the more vulnerable pole.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Critique remains viable where distance can be stabilized as interruptability within a legible frame. Drift begins where impulse substitutes for interruption, where distance collapses into detachment, or where framed relevance is lost. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by treating distance as a structural interrupt-capacity rather than as a personal virtue or attitude.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by differentiating critique from reaction without shaming, ranking, or person-labeling.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Minimal critique is governable where configurations can interrupt themselves before impulse discharges or detachment hardens. Instability arises where distance is unavailable, misread as politeness, or replaced by escalation or withdrawal. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Critique begins where a mismatch becomes interruptible: without distance, there is response, but not critique.

## 3. Productive Critique: From Interruption to Correction (Φ/Σ)

### 3.1 Thesis

This chapter establishes that critique becomes *productive* only when it moves beyond interruption and stabilizes as correction. Interruption creates distance and suspends immediate reaction, but it does not by itself alter trajectories. Productivity begins only where the configuration can **recontextualize (Φ: embed the mismatch into a new or adjusted frame)** and **integrate (Σ: synthesize the relevant elements into a coherent corrective step)**.

The decisive distinction is therefore not between *true* and *false* critique, nor between *polite* and *harsh* critique, but between critique that merely *articulates* a mismatch and critique that *changes coordination*. Productive critique alters what becomes possible next. It reduces ambiguity about how to proceed, redistributes attention from commentary to correction, and creates a step that can be carried forward under time and asymmetry.

Importantly, this does not imply consensus, harmony, or success. Productive critique may still fail, be rejected, or generate new conflict. What makes it productive is not acceptance, but structural reach: the ability to transform interruption into a coherent action possibility rather than leaving the configuration suspended in reaction, explanation, or exposure dynamics.

### 3.2 Productive Formula (Operatorial)

The operator composition that characterizes productive critique is:

```

CRITIQUE_prod := Σ ∘ Χ ∘ Φ ∘ (Θ, Ω, □, Δ)

```

A mismatch becomes legible within a frame, interruption creates distance, recontextualization shifts or refines the frame so that the mismatch becomes bearable and actionable, and integration consolidates a coherent corrective step. Temporality (Θ: accumulation, timing, review windows) and asymmetry (Ω: exposure and cost gradients) are not optional modifiers; they shape whether recontextualization can remain actionable and whether integration can be sustained.

This composition specifies a *structural possibility*, not a guarantee. Even where all elements are present, correction can still be blocked by later breaks, refusals, or external shocks. Conversely, where any element is missing, critique may still appear forceful or convincing, but it will not consolidate into correction.

### 3.3 Recontextualization (Φ): Making Mismatch Bearable and Actionable

Recontextualization is the pivot between interruption and integration. Its function is not to excuse, soften, or narratively repair a mismatch, but to embed it into a frame in which coordinated action becomes thinkable. Φ adjusts relevance, scope, and perspective so that the mismatch no longer overwhelms the configuration.

In practice, recontextualization may involve narrowing a diffuse complaint into a specific coordination problem, expanding a narrow accusation into a shared constraint, or shifting from personal attribution to role-based handling. What matters structurally is that the mismatch becomes *situated* in a way that preserves distance while reducing paralysis.

Recontextualization fails when it becomes an end in itself. Excessive reframing, endless explanation, or rhetorical sophistication can stabilize as substitutes for action. In such cases, Φ inflates while Σ remains unreachable, and critique drifts into narrative repair or intellectual display without correction.

### 3.4 Integration (Σ): Consolidating a Corrective Step

Integration is the synthesis point where critique becomes correction. Σ aligns the relevant elements—difference, frame, constraints, impulses, and asymmetries—into a coherent step that can actually be taken. This step may be provisional, partial, or contested, but it must be *integrated*: it must reduce fragmentation and make “what happens next” more coherent than before.

Integration is not judgment and not enforcement. It does not require agreement on values or motives. It requires that the configuration can coordinate around a next move without relying on repetition, power, or silence. Integration therefore marks the transition from critique as commentary to critique as praxis.

Integration is often the most fragile point in the chain. It is costly, because it exposes commitments under time and asymmetry. It also creates accountability pressure, because once a step is articulated, non-follow-up becomes legible. Where integration is systematically avoided, critique stabilizes as talk, performance, or escalation rather than as correction.

### 3.5 Common Integration Substitutes (Drift Patterns)

When integration does not occur, configurations often stabilize substitutes that simulate productivity while avoiding its costs.

Narrative inflation arises when recontextualization expands without consolidation. The situation is repeatedly reframed, historicized, or theorized, but no corrective step emerges. Repetition replaces clarification when attractor dynamics dominate: the same critique is voiced again and again, producing familiarity rather than resolution. Power substitution occurs when asymmetry is used to force outcomes, bypassing coordination and producing compliance without integration. Withdrawal and silence occur when the costs of exposure or commitment are externalized, leaving the mismatch acknowledged but unaddressed.

These substitutes are structurally intelligible responses to high costs, unclear roles, or compressed time windows. They are not moral defects, but they do explain why critique so often fails to become correction even when content is accurate.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes that critique becomes productive only when interruption is followed by recontextualization and integration. The decisive point is that interruption alone suspends reaction but does not alter trajectories. Productivity arises when a mismatch is embedded into a frame that makes action possible and then consolidated into a coherent corrective step (Φ: recontextualization; Σ: integration). Strong opinions, accurate observations, or elaborate explanations are insufficient if they do not change coordination. Productive critique is therefore a chain property under time and asymmetry, not a function of conviction or force.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** missing or compressed review windows increase the likelihood that commentary replaces correction and that unresolved tension accumulates.
- **Λ (non-event load):** acknowledged mismatches without integrated steps generate persistent pressure that seeks stabilization.
- **Α (script costs):** repeated reframing or repetition stabilizes scripts that consume attention while narrowing future options.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** unequal exposure raises the cost of integration and incentivizes power or silence as cheaper substitutes.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Productive critique remains viable where recontextualization stays oriented toward action and integration consolidates a next step within available time windows. Drift begins where recontextualization substitutes for integration, where repetition hardens into routine, or where power or withdrawal replaces coordination. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by maintaining interruption as a meta-position rather than converting critique into performance or enforcement.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by routing critique through structure, costs, and viability rather than shaming or ranking.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Productive critique is governable where configurations support action-oriented recontextualization and timely integration under asymmetry. Instability arises where substitutes become cheaper than integration or where exposure gradients discourage consolidation. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Critique becomes productive only when interruption is recontextualized into action and integrated into a coherent corrective step under time and asymmetry.

## 4. Vertical Axis: Depth / Reach of Critique (operator reach)

*(“vertical axis”: how far does the critique chain extend, and where does it break?)*

### 4.1 Depth Levels (Neutral Ladder)

This chapter introduces a vertical reading of critique episodes based on **how far the operator chain reaches**, not on moral quality, rhetorical strength, or correctness of content. Depth here is strictly structural. It describes which operations become reachable in a given configuration and which remain blocked. A deeper reach does not mean “better critique”; it means that more elements of the correction chain are structurally available.

At the lowest level, **difference (Δ: differentiation)** alone produces irritation. Something feels off or noticeable, but there is no shared relevance and no interruption. When a **frame (□: relevance structure)** is added, the irritation becomes nameable inside a practice grammar: something can be pointed out as “out of place,” “wrong,” or “problematic,” yet without critique proper.

The introduction of **distance (Χ: interruption / meta-position)** marks the threshold of critique in the strict sense. At this level, reaction is suspended and the configuration gains the ability to pause, question, or hold open alternatives. Critique exists here as interruption, but it is still fragile and easily collapses back into reaction or drift.

With **recontextualization (Φ: frame shift)**, critique gains reach. The mismatch is no longer only interrupted but embedded into a revised or expanded frame that makes it bearable and situable. The critique now has a target that can be worked with rather than merely opposed.

When **integration (Σ: synthesis into coherence)** becomes reachable, critique turns into correction. A coherent next step emerges that aligns constraints, roles, impulses, and expectations. This step may be provisional, partial, or contested, but it reduces fragmentation and clarifies coordination.

At the highest reach, **self-binding (Ψ: binding across time)** stabilizes critique beyond the episode. Follow-up, accountability, review, and repair become part of a trajectory rather than isolated events. Critique here is no longer only an intervention; it becomes part of an ongoing practice.

### 4.2 Breakpoints and Typical Forms

Most critique episodes do not traverse the full ladder. They stabilize at specific breakpoints, which generate recognizable forms that are often misidentified as critique itself.

Where the chain breaks **before distance (Χ)**, reaction dominates. Outrage, mockery, attack, or flight emerge as impulse-driven responses. These may carry strong content and high visibility, but they lack interruption and therefore cannot stabilize as critique.

Where the chain breaks **before recontextualization (Φ)**, critique hardens into “hard truth” rhetoric or frame clashes. A mismatch is named and interruption occurs, but the frame remains unchanged. The result is often escalation or stalemate, because the target remains unbearable or unworkable.

Where the chain breaks **before integration (Σ)**, analysis proliferates without correction. Commentary, diagnosis, or explanation accumulates, but no coherent step emerges. The configuration remains suspended, and pressure is displaced into repetition or withdrawal.

Where the chain breaks **before self-binding (Ψ)**, critique produces insight without trajectory change. The episode may feel clarifying or cathartic, but nothing is carried forward. Over time, this stabilizes as a pattern of one-off interventions that never consolidate into practice change.

These breakpoints are not failures of character or intelligence. They are predictable stabilization points under cost, exposure, and time constraints.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes depth as a structural measure of how far a critique episode reaches along the correction chain. The decisive point is that depth does not rank critique morally and does not imply superiority. It describes which operations become reachable in a given configuration, from irritation through interruption to correction and binding. Many phenomena commonly called critique stabilize at intermediate levels and never reach integration or follow-up. Understanding depth therefore clarifies why critique so often feels intense yet ineffective. The vertical axis makes visible where the chain stops and what kind of form stabilizes as a result.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** shallow reach accumulates costs over time, as unresolved episodes repeat without trajectory change.
- **Λ (non-event load):** missing steps in the chain generate persistent pressure that seeks stabilization elsewhere.
- **Α (script costs):** repeated breakpoints harden into predictable patterns such as commentary, outrage, or episodic insight.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** deeper reach increases exposure and commitment costs, making early breakpoints structurally cheaper.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Structurally viable configurations make it possible to extend critique beyond interruption toward integration without forcing full binding in every episode. Drift begins where depth is confused with virtue, where interruption substitutes for correction, or where repeated shallow reach becomes the default. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by treating depth as an analytic dimension rather than as a personal achievement.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by avoiding depth-based shaming or ranking and by describing reach without degradation.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Critique remains governable where configurations recognize depth limits and manage them explicitly. Instability arises where shallow reach is mistaken for completion or where deeper reach is demanded without structural support. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Depth in critique is not virtue but reach: it marks how far interruption travels toward correction and binding within a given configuration.

## 5. Horizontal Axis: Scale of Critique (a–d)

*(“horizontal axis”: where asymmetry (Ω: exposure gradients) and temporality (Θ: accumulation and irreversibility) stabilize across scale)*

### 5.1 a) Generic / Structural Critique (No Actor Binding)

At the most abstract level, critique is treated as a **formal structural possibility** rather than as an enacted episode. No specific actor, role, or scene is bound. The focus is exclusively on operator movement: how differentiation, interruption, recontextualization, and integration can, in principle, compose into critique and correction.

This scale is used for modeling, comparison, and architectural clarity. It allows critique to be described independently of personal exposure, responsibility attribution, or follow-up commitments. Asymmetry and temporality are present only as abstract parameters, not as lived gradients. Nothing is at stake for anyone in particular, which makes this scale analytically clean but practically incomplete.

At this level, critique exists as grammar, not as risk-bearing praxis. It clarifies *what critique is structurally*, but it does not yet explain why critique so often fails in real configurations.

**Reference:** CRITIQUE_min and CRITIQUE_prod as pure structure, without actor binding.

### 5.2 b) Single-Subject Critique (Self / Support / Learning)

At the single-subject scale, critique becomes inwardly bound. The subject occupies both poles of the configuration: the one who interrupts and the one whose trajectory is affected. Asymmetry (Ω: imbalance of exposure and obligation) is internalized as a self↔world mismatch rather than distributed across roles.

Distance (Χ: interruption / meta-position) must be self-generated. There is no external stop-capability unless explicitly scaffolded by a support structure. Recontextualization often takes the form of reframing one’s own situation, and integration aims at clarifying a next step that can be enacted by the same subject.

Self-binding (Ψ: binding across time) is optional but decisive. Where it occurs, critique consolidates into learning, checking, or asking patterns that alter future trajectories. Where it does not, critique remains episodic and easily dissolves.

Typical drifts at this scale include under-questioning (Δ acknowledged but not framed), over-framing (excessive contextualization without consolidation), recontextualization inflation (Φ without Σ), and avoidance of integration due to anticipated self-exposure costs.

### 5.3 c) Small Group Critique (Peers / Team / Family)

At the small-group scale, critique becomes relational. Asymmetry (Ω: who may interrupt whom, who bears consequences) is no longer internal but distributed across roles. Distance (Χ) is harder to generate because interruption now affects relationships, status, and belonging.

Non-events (Λ: structured absence) become central. Not intervening, not naming, or not correcting are highly visible to those involved, even when nothing is said. Over time, repeated non-intervention stabilizes attractor patterns (Α: scripts), such as “we don’t say things,” “we joke instead,” or “we shame indirectly.”

Responsibility diffusion emerges as a key phenomenon at this scale. It is not a lack of care or courage, but a predictable result of unclear role-space combined with uneven exposure costs. Each participant waits for another to interrupt, while the non-event accumulates.

Where critique does occur, integration is often negotiated and fragile. Binding (Ψ) may take the form of informal agreements, follow-up norms, or shared memory of “what we decided,” but it remains vulnerable to drift.

### 5.4 d) Public Critique (Street / Media / Online)

At the public scale, critique operates under maximal amplification. Exposure gradients (Ω) are steep, temporality (Θ) hardens into irreversibility, and stabilization speed (Α) increases dramatically. Distance (Χ) becomes fragile because interruption is immediately entangled with visibility, performance, and audience dynamics.

Integration (Σ) is costly, because any articulated step is exposed to contestation, misinterpretation, and permanent record. Self-binding (Ψ) is rare and often replaced by performative signals of alignment or opposition. As a result, critique frequently mutates into shaming, outrage cycles, or silence driven by bystander paralysis.

A crucial clarification is the **publicness overlay (P)**. Publicness is not an operator and does not generate critique by itself. It is a structurally neutral amplification layer that increases exposure, accelerates stabilization, and hardens temporal consequences when critique chains break early. Publicness therefore increases drift sensitivity without implying that publicity or digital media are inherently problematic.

Understanding public critique requires separating operator grammar from amplification effects. Many failures attributed to “bad discourse” are structurally explainable as early chain breaks under extreme Ω/Θ/Α amplification.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes scale as a horizontal axis that determines where costs, exposure, and temporal effects stabilize in critique. The decisive point is that the same operator grammar applies across all scales, but stability conditions change dramatically. As critique moves from abstract structure to single subjects, small groups, and publics, asymmetry and temporality become increasingly consequential. Publicness does not change what critique is, but it changes how quickly and irreversibly critique mutates when chains break. Scale therefore explains why structurally similar critique attempts have radically different outcomes.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** larger scales harden consequences faster, reducing opportunities for revision and repair.
- **Λ (non-event load):** in groups and publics, silence and non-intervention accumulate pressure that is widely perceived.
- **Α (script costs):** repetition under scale stabilizes recognizable patterns such as joking cultures, outrage cycles, or chronic silence.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** exposure increases with scale, externalizing costs unevenly and discouraging integration.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Critique remains viable where scale-appropriate support exists for interruption, recontextualization, and integration. Drift begins where amplification outpaces stop-capacity or where exposure costs make integration structurally unattractive. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by analyzing scale effects without turning them into personal blame or media critique.
- **Reversibility:** interpretations remain scene- and scale-bound; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by refusing scale-based shaming and by treating exposure as a structural gradient, not a moral verdict.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Critique is governable at all scales, but drift sensitivity increases with scale due to amplification of exposure and irreversibility. Instability arises where scale effects are ignored or misattributed to character. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

The operators stay the same, but scale decides the cost: as critique moves into publicness, exposure and irreversibility amplify drift without adding new structure.

## 6. Derived Axes as Projections (A/C/R/E/D)

*(No new dimensions; mapping only)*

This chapter introduces the derived axes A/C/R/E/D as **readable projections** of the operator grammar already established. These axes do not add primitives, do not introduce evaluative scales, and do not function as diagnostics. Their sole function is to make complex operator chains legible at a glance, especially when comparing configurations across scale and depth.

Each axis answers a specific structural question that routinely arises in critique scenes. Importantly, none of these questions can be answered by a single operator. Each axis is therefore defined as a **composition**, not as a trait or capacity. The axes are projections: they collapse operator movement into a readable dimension without replacing the underlying grammar.

### 6.1 Awareness (A) in Critique

Awareness in critique refers to **what is differentiated, framed, and sustained across time**. Structurally, it answers the question: *who knows what, when, and where*—without making any claim about insight, intelligence, or consciousness.

Formally, awareness is projected as **A = Θ ∘ □ ∘ Δ**. A difference becomes visible, the frame determines its relevance, and temporality stabilizes this relevance across episodes. In critique scenes, awareness often exists long before critique occurs. A mismatch can be widely known and repeatedly recognized without ever becoming interrupted or corrected.

This is why awareness must not be confused with critique itself. High awareness does not imply critique, and low awareness does not imply negligence. Awareness only describes the persistence and distribution of framed differentiation over time.

### 6.2 Coherence (C) in Critique

Coherence captures the **stability of expectations and narrative legibility** within a critique configuration. It answers the question: *does the situation make sense over time, including its silences and delays?*

Structurally, coherence is projected as **C = Θ ∘ Λ ∘ □ ∘ ∇**. Impulses are constrained by frames, non-events encode expectations, and temporality turns these into a recognizable trajectory. In critique contexts, coherence can exist even where critique fails. A group may have a very coherent story about why nothing is said, why issues recur, or why interventions never consolidate.

Crucially, coherence does not imply truth, correctness, or justice. A configuration can be highly coherent and deeply dysfunctional. Coherence only indicates that the pattern holds together narratively and predictably under time.

### 6.3 Action (E) in Critique

Action marks the point where critique becomes **enactable correction** rather than commentary. It answers the question: *is there a coherent next step that can actually be taken?*

Formally, action is projected as **E = Σ ∘ Θ ∘ ∇**. Directed impulse is extended across time and integrated into a coherent enactment. In critique scenes, action is often the missing axis. Many configurations generate awareness and even interruption without ever making action reachable.

The absence of action does not mean that “nothing happens.” It means that pressure is displaced into repetition, escalation, or withdrawal. Action therefore functions as a diagnostic projection for whether critique has crossed the threshold into correction.

### 6.4 Responsibility (R) in Critique

Responsibility describes **who owns follow-up under asymmetry over time**. It answers the question: *who is bound to carry consequences, repair, or continuation once critique has occurred?*

Structurally, responsibility is projected as **R = Ψ ∘ Φ ∘ Θ ∘ Ω**. Asymmetry defines exposure and obligation, temporality extends this imbalance, recontextualization adapts obligations to changing frames, and self-binding stabilizes them as owned commitments.

In critique contexts, responsibility is frequently diffused rather than absent. Many actors may partially recontextualize obligations without binding themselves to follow-up. Responsibility diffusion is therefore not a moral failure but a structural pattern in which binding never consolidates.

### 6.5 Dignity-in-Practice (D) in Critique

Dignity-in-practice marks **restraint under asymmetry**. It answers the question: *how is power, exposure, and vulnerability handled during critique?*

Formally, dignity-in-practice is projected as **D = Ψ ∘ Χ ∘ Ω**. Asymmetry is recognized, distance enables restraint, and self-binding commits the configuration to non-degradation across time. D does not rank persons and does not assert ontological worth. It constrains *how* critique may be enacted when exposure is uneven.

In critique scenes, collapse of dignity-in-practice is structurally visible as pillory dynamics: exposure escalates, irreversibility hardens, and restraint disappears. Importantly, correct content does not compensate for collapse of D. Dignity-in-practice is a condition of viable critique, not a reward for being right.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes A/C/R/E/D as readable projections of the operator grammar, not as independent dimensions. The decisive point is that these axes do not explain critique; they summarize how critique configurations behave when viewed through specific structural questions. Awareness captures sustained differentiation, coherence captures narrative stability, action captures enactable correction, responsibility captures bound follow-up, and dignity-in-practice captures restraint under asymmetry. None of these axes stands alone. Each is generated by operator compositions already in play.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** projections become legible only through accumulation; missing action or binding increases long-term costs.
- **Λ (non-event load):** absent critique stabilizes coherence without correction, increasing interpretive pressure.
- **Α (script costs):** repeated projection patterns harden into expectations about “how critique works here.”
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** uneven exposure distorts responsibility and threatens dignity-in-practice.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Configurations remain viable where projections are read as indicators rather than as verdicts, and where gaps between axes are addressed structurally. Drift begins where projections are mistaken for traits, rankings, or moral judgments. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by treating axes as analytic views, not as labels of persons or groups.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by refusing axis-based shaming or competence hierarchies.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Derived axes support critique analysis where they remain projections of structure rather than substitutes for it. Instability arises where axes are reified into judgments or used to bypass operator analysis. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

A/C/R/E/D do not add dimensions to critique; they project how the same operator grammar becomes readable across awareness, coherence, action, responsibility, and restraint.

## 7. Core Phenomena: Bystander, Diffusion, and “Non-Critique Attractors”

This chapter consolidates several frequently moralized phenomena—bystander behavior, silence, mockery, and diffusion—into a single structural field. The aim is not to normalize these outcomes, but to explain why they stabilize so reliably in critique-relevant configurations. What is commonly attributed to weakness, cowardice, or apathy is here treated as the result of operator interactions under asymmetry and time.

The chapter therefore reframes bystander dynamics as **outcomes of configuration**, not as failures of character. It shows how critique pressure can be present and widely recognized, yet fail to trigger interruption or correction because the structural conditions required for critique-in-strict-sense never consolidate.

### 7.1 Thesis

Bystander effects emerge when critique-relevant pressure encounters asymmetry gradients, structured non-events, and pattern stabilization over time. In such configurations, silence is not an absence of engagement but a specific stabilization path that manages exposure and risk.

Structurally, three elements interact. **Asymmetry (Ω)** distributes exposure and cost unevenly. **Non-events (Λ)** encode the absence of intervention as meaningful within the frame. **Attractors (Α)** stabilize repeated responses—such as silence, joking, or deflection—into scripts. Under **temporality (Θ)**, these scripts harden, making future interruption increasingly costly.

The decisive point is that none of this requires lack of awareness or lack of concern. Bystander configurations often exhibit high awareness and high coherence, while still producing no critique and no correction.

### 7.2 Minimal Drift Formulae (illustrative)

Several minimal constellations recur across domains. These are not exhaustive models, but illustrative signatures that make stabilization paths legible.

**Paralysis or silence** arises where non-events combine with asymmetry under time. When expected intervention fails to occur, and exposure is uneven, silence becomes the lowest-cost stabilization in the short term. Over time, this silence accumulates and becomes increasingly difficult to interrupt.

**Diffusion** arises where asymmetry is distributed across multiple actors and the role space remains unclear. When it is structurally ambiguous who may interrupt whom, distance (Χ) is not triggered, and responsibility remains unbound. Everyone can see the mismatch; no one becomes the interrupter.

**Mockery attractors** arise where repeated non-intervention stabilizes into indirect handling. In frames where public exposure is present, ridicule or irony can become a low-risk way to discharge tension without assuming responsibility for correction. Once stabilized, mockery functions as a substitute for critique rather than as its variant.

These patterns differ in surface form, but share a common logic: critique pressure is managed without interruption and integration.

### 7.3 What Makes Diffusion Stable (Mechanism Blocks)

Responsibility diffusion persists because several structural blocks reinforce one another.

First, **unclear role space (□)** prevents interruption from becoming legitimate. Even when a mismatch is evident, actors cannot locate a stable position from which critique could be enacted without overstepping.

Second, **shifted cost layouts (Ω)** make intervention asymmetrically expensive. Exposure, retaliation, or reputational risk are concentrated on potential interrupters, while the benefits of correction remain diffuse.

Third, **lack of review windows (Θ)** removes opportunities for delayed or staged critique. When timing is compressed or indefinite, the moment for interruption either passes immediately or never clearly arrives.

Fourth, **repetition of non-intervention (Λ → Α)** stabilizes silence itself as the expected response. Over time, the configuration no longer waits for critique; it expects non-critique, and deviations from silence become the anomaly.

Together, these blocks explain why diffusion is not fragile. It is often the most stable outcome available to the configuration.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes bystander behavior and responsibility diffusion as predictable stabilization forms in critique-relevant configurations. The decisive point is that silence, deferral, and mockery are not empty responses but structured ways of handling critique pressure under asymmetry and time. When exposure is uneven and role space remains unclear, interruption does not consolidate. Repeated non-events then stabilize into attractors that manage tension without correction. These outcomes can persist even under high awareness and shared recognition of mismatch.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** short-term risk avoidance accumulates into long-term rigidity, making later intervention increasingly costly.
- **Λ (non-event load):** repeated silence carries interpretive pressure that seeks stabilization rather than resolution.
- **Α (script costs):** stabilized non-critique scripts narrow future options and normalize inaction.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** costs of intervention concentrate on a few positions, while costs of non-intervention diffuse.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Configurations remain viable where role space allows interruption to become legitimate and where non-events do not substitute for coordination. Drift begins where silence becomes the default handler of critique pressure and where stabilized scripts replace interruption and follow-up. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by analyzing silence and diffusion as structural paths, not as personal deficits.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by refusing to shame bystanders or moralize diffusion.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Responsibility diffusion is structurally governable where interruption can become legitimate and follow-up can bind. Instability arises where silence stabilizes as the primary response to critique pressure. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Bystander effects are not failures of character but stable outcomes of asymmetry, non-events, and time managing critique pressure without interruption.

## 8. Drift Typology (Critique Mutations)

This chapter introduces a compact typology of critique drift. Its purpose is not to evaluate outcomes or actors, but to make visible how critique chains mutate when specific operator capacities fail to consolidate or are substituted under load. Drift here names **structural deviation**, not moral failure. Each class describes a recognizable stabilization form that emerges when critique pressure is handled without reaching integration or binding.

The typology is operator-strict and constellation-based. It does not rely on intent, attitude, or inner state, and it does not presuppose low awareness or bad faith. Drift often emerges precisely in configurations with high awareness and strong expressive capacity, but where interruption, recontextualization, or integration are structurally blocked or replaced.

Whenever distance (Χ) is referenced in the following typology, it is treated as a reduced signature that presupposes its PMS dependencies—recontextualization (Φ), temporality (Θ), and framing (□)—rather than as a standalone capacity or trait.  

### 8.1 Main Drift Classes

**1. Reaction masquerading as critique (impulse without distance).**  
In this configuration, mismatch triggers immediate directional response, but no meta-position becomes available. Expression is fast, affect-loaded, and often loud, yet structurally indistinguishable from reaction. What looks like critique is in fact impulse discharge stabilized by repetition. The absence of distance prevents interruption from becoming critique-in-strict-sense, even if the content overlaps.

**2. Judgment masquerading as critique (frame plus differentiation without integration).**  
Here, a mismatch is named within a frame, but the chain does not move toward recontextualization or integration. Evaluation replaces coordination. Asymmetry is often leveraged to fix meaning rather than to manage correction. The result is categorical judgment that stabilizes clarity at the cost of actionability.

**3. Narrative repair masquerading as critique (recontextualization without integration).**  
In this drift, critique pressure is handled by continuous reframing. The situation is repeatedly explained, contextualized, or interpreted in new ways, but no coherent corrective step consolidates. Recontextualization becomes an end in itself. Over time, narrative density increases while correction remains unreachable.

**4. Commentary or analysis paralysis (distance without integration).**  
Here, distance is present and often explicitly valued, but it does not connect to integration. The configuration stabilizes reflective observation, meta-commentary, or critique-about-critique. While this can reduce immediate escalation, it also suspends correction indefinitely. Distance becomes a holding pattern rather than a bridge.

**5. Public pillory (exposure amplification with collapsed restraint).**  
This drift emerges where exposure gradients intensify, stabilization accelerates, and irreversibility hardens. Critique pressure is redirected into public degradation. Once stabilized, the configuration no longer distinguishes between interruption and punishment. Dignity-in-practice collapses, not because content is false, but because exposure replaces coordination.

**6. Silence attractor (non-event stabilization).**  
In this form, repeated non-intervention becomes the dominant script. Silence manages risk and exposure in the short term, but stabilizes into an attractor that forecloses later interruption. The configuration no longer expects critique; it expects non-critique, and deviations from silence become costly.

These classes are not mutually exclusive. Configurations often move through several drift forms as load increases or as substitution cascades occur.

### 8.2 Drift Chains (Typical Sequences)

Drift rarely appears as a single failure point. More commonly, it unfolds as a chain. A frequent sequence in high-exposure configurations begins with rising asymmetry, which erodes distance under pressure. Reaction then hardens into a pattern through repetition, and temporal accumulation makes reversal increasingly costly. In other contexts, prolonged narrative repair delays integration until attention shifts, at which point silence stabilizes as the default outcome.

Such chains explain why critique episodes can begin with recognizable concern and end in forms that appear unrelated to correction. The mutation is structural, not intentional.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes drift as a family of predictable critique mutations that arise when specific capacities fail to consolidate or are replaced. The decisive point is that drift does not require bad intent, ignorance, or moral failure. Each drift class corresponds to a recognizable substitution within the critique chain, where reaction, judgment, narrative handling, observation, exposure, or silence take the place of correction. Drift names how critique pressure is stabilized without integration or binding. Structural naming makes these mutations legible without personalizing them.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** early substitutions accumulate into rigid trajectories that are increasingly difficult to reverse.
- **Λ (non-event load):** delayed or suspended correction builds interpretive pressure that seeks alternative stabilization.
- **Α (script costs):** once a drift form stabilizes, it narrows future response options and normalizes deviation.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** higher exposure amplifies the cost of interruption and accelerates drift stabilization.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Configurations remain viable where interruption can still transition into recontextualization and integration. Drift begins where substitutions become self-reinforcing and replace coordination as the dominant handler of critique pressure. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** maintained by treating drift classes as structural mutations rather than personal defects.
- **Reversibility:** classifications remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by refusing to use drift labels as instruments of shaming or ranking.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Drift patterns are governable where configurations still allow movement toward integration and follow-up. Instability arises where substitutions harden into scripts that foreclose correction. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Drift is not “bad critique,” but a predictable mutation of critique chains when substitution replaces integration under load.

---

## 9. Modulators (Operator Weightings; No Typing)

This chapter introduces modulators as a disciplined way to talk about *why the same operator grammar stabilizes differently across scenes* without smuggling in traits, diagnoses, or moral rankings. A modulator is not a new primitive and not a hidden “cause.” It is a **weighting condition** that changes how easily certain transitions in the critique chain become reachable, how quickly substitutions stabilize, and where costs accumulate. In other words: modulators do not redefine critique; they shift its **stability conditions**.

Modulators are necessary because critique scenes are rarely “operator-clean.” A configuration can contain the full conceptual possibility of interruption, recontextualization, and integration, yet still drift, because the environment loads the chain unevenly. In PMS terms, critique is not only a sequence; it is a **sequence under load**. Modulators name the load patterns in a way that remains structural, scene-bound, and reversible.

Two constraints govern this chapter. First, modulators are not person descriptions. They do not categorize individuals, groups, or institutions as types. Second, modulators are not prescriptions. Naming a modulator does not imply that a configuration is “wrong” or that it should be optimized. The aim is clarity: when critique fails or mutates, modulators allow the analysis to say *where the chain became drift-sensitive* without collapsing into moralizing or psychologizing.

### 9.1 Thesis

Modulators are **operator weightings**: structural conditions that change which critique constellations stabilize and how drift forms become likely. They are not additional operators and they do not introduce new dimensions. They describe how strongly a configuration loads the critique chain at specific transition points—especially the transitions from framed differentiation to distance, from distance to recontextualization, and from recontextualization to integration.

The decisive point is that modulators can make drift look “inevitable” even when the operator grammar is understood. This does not mean drift is morally excused, nor does it mean that critique is “impossible.” It means that the chain’s viability corridor narrows: costs rise, reversibility shrinks, and substitutions stabilize faster than correction.

### 9.2 Critique-Relevant Modulators (Structural Examples)

**Frame clarity (□ clarity: role-space and speakability).**  
Frame clarity modulates whether a mismatch can be named as relevant without immediately triggering conflict about the frame itself. Where role-space is legible, interruption can be targeted rather than diffuse: it is clearer *who may speak, in what register, and with what implied obligations*. Where frame clarity is low, critique pressure often mutates into meta-conflict (“what are we even doing here?”), policing, or silence. Low clarity increases drift sensitivity because the chain spends its energy stabilizing the frame instead of moving toward correction.

**Non-event density (Λ density: non-response cultures).**  
Non-event density modulates how much interpretive pressure is produced by absence. In high-density configurations, non-response is frequent and meaningful: delays, omissions, and “nothing happened” become the dominant steering medium. This increases load on critique because interruption becomes risky and costly while absence is already doing coordination work. High Λ density often produces attractor-like stabilization of silence, deferral, or indirectness, not because critique is morally rejected but because the configuration’s default coordination grammar runs through non-events.

**Asymmetry visibility (Ω visibility: exposure gradients and status).**  
Asymmetry visibility modulates whether critique costs are experienced as localized or as publicly consequential. When exposure gradients are salient, interruption is not only about content; it is about who becomes exposed, who carries reputational or relational cost, and who can safely retract. High visibility increases the probability that critique is displaced into judgment, performance, or silence, because integration becomes expensive and reversibility shrinks. This modulator is descriptive: it does not declare asymmetry “bad,” it makes cost layouts explicit.

**Temporal compression (Θ compression: time pressure vs. review windows).**  
Temporal compression modulates whether critique can move beyond interruption within available time. When review windows are narrow or absent, critique tends to stabilize as reaction (“fast signal”) or as deferral (“later”), with integration becoming structurally unreachable. Conversely, where review windows exist, critique chains can tolerate complexity without collapsing into escalation or paralysis. The point is not virtue but feasibility: timing shapes whether correction can consolidate.

**Recontextualization habituation (Φ habituation: reframing as default).**  
Recontextualization habituation modulates whether reframing functions as a bridge or as a substitute. In some configurations, reframing is routinely used to keep situations bearable and coordinated; in others, it becomes the dominant coping mechanism that prevents integration from ever consolidating. High habituation can therefore produce the drift form “narrative repair,” where meaning work expands while correction remains suspended. This is not a psychological claim; it is a stability pattern of how critique pressure is managed.

**Distance availability (Χ availability: stop-capacity inside the frame).**  
Distance availability modulates whether interruption can occur without immediate fusion into reaction or performance. Some frames structurally support stop-capability—pauses, turn-taking, and meta-positions are legible. Other frames penalize them, treating interruption as weakness, betrayal, or loss of momentum. Low Χ availability increases drift sensitivity because the chain cannot reliably cross the threshold from impulse to critique-in-strict-sense. This is a configuration feature: the same actor may exhibit high distance in one frame and low distance in another.

**Attractor inertia (Α inertia: stabilization speed of scripts).**  
Attractor inertia modulates how quickly repeated handling becomes a default script. High inertia means scripts harden rapidly and become self-reinforcing; deviation becomes costly. In critique scenes, this often means that one drift form—mockery, silence, judgment, or outrage—becomes the easiest repeatable outcome. Once stabilized, the configuration “remembers” the script more strongly than it remembers the initial mismatch, and critique is processed through the script rather than through the operator chain toward correction.

**Publicness overlay (P: explicit amplification modulator; non-operatorial).**  
Publicness is treated here as an overlay, not as a source of critique and not as an operator. It modulates critique by amplifying exposure gradients (Ω), hardening irreversibility (Θ), and accelerating stabilization speed (Α) under publicity gradients. The overlay is structurally neutral: it does not imply that public critique is inherently illegitimate or that a medium is “bad.” It names a load pattern: when a chain breaks early, publicness tends to make the break harder to reverse and the resulting drift more quickly stabilized. The critical consequence is increased drift sensitivity without any change in the underlying primitives.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes modulators as structural weightings that explain why identical operator grammars stabilize differently across configurations. The decisive point is that modulators do not add new primitives and do not classify persons; they describe how the critique chain is loaded at key transitions. Frame clarity, non-event density, asymmetry visibility, temporal compression, reframing habituation, distance availability, and attractor inertia change what becomes reachable under pressure. Publicness functions as an overlay that amplifies exposure, irreversibility, and stabilization speed without generating critique by itself. Modulators therefore make drift sensitivity describable without moralizing or psychologizing.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (temporality):** where timing is compressed or review windows are absent, correction becomes structurally expensive and drift stabilizes as a trajectory.
- **Λ (non-event load):** high non-event density shifts coordination into absence, increasing interpretive pressure and making interruption costlier.
- **Α (script costs):** high attractor inertia hardens default scripts, narrowing future response options and accelerating stabilization of drift.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** high visibility of asymmetry increases the cost of interruption and reduces practical reversibility, especially under publicness overlays.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Configurations remain viable where modulators leave a corridor in which interruption can move toward integration rather than being substituted by performance, narrative expansion, or silence. Drift begins where modulators systematically block that corridor—when non-events do the steering, when time windows collapse, when exposure costs dominate, or when scripts harden faster than correction can consolidate. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** maintained by treating modulators as scene conditions that shift reachability, not as personal deficits or virtues.
- **Reversibility:** modulator readings remain configuration-bound and revisable; accumulated effects under temporality remain real.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by refusing to use modulator labels as instruments of shaming, ranking, or delegitimization.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Critique remains governable where modulator load does not foreclose the transition from interruption to integration and where drift does not harden into default scripts. Instability arises where modulators amplify exposure, compress time, and accelerate attractor stabilization such that substitution becomes the dominant handler of critique pressure. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Modulators do not change the critique grammar; they change what the chain can reach, and how quickly drift hardens under load.

## 10. Dignity-in-Practice (D) in Critique (Protection Module, Non-Moralizing)

This chapter specifies dignity-in-practice as a **structural protection condition** for critique under asymmetry. The point is not to introduce a moral doctrine and not to assert ontological worth. Dignity-in-practice is treated as an *enacted restraint* that keeps critique from mutating into degradation when power, exposure, and irreversibility are present. In this paper’s scope, D functions like a boundary condition: it marks when critique remains critique as a praxeological operation and when it becomes structurally invalid as a critique practice because it has switched to a different operation (public punishment, humiliation, reputational annihilation, or coercive steering through exposure).

The need for this module follows from the earlier chapters. Critique is defined as an interruption that becomes productive only when recontextualization and integration can occur and can become stable only when follow-up can be bound into a trajectory. Under asymmetry, these transitions are fragile: exposure costs can dominate, review windows can collapse, and scripts can harden quickly. In such conditions, a critique episode can preserve its *content* while losing its *structure*: it can be factually correct yet function as pillory dynamics rather than correction. This chapter therefore treats D as a structural minimum that protects the possibility of critique-as-correction under high load.

Dignity-in-practice is also a validity safeguard for the paper itself. Because the topic of critique invites performative condemnation, the paper must be able to describe degradation dynamics without reproducing them. D is the mechanism by which “naming drift” does not become “doing drift.” The chapter is explicit that D is not a requirement imposed on discourse in general. It is a constraint on PMS-CRITIQUE as an application and on critique episodes insofar as they claim to be critique rather than punishment.

### 10.1 Purpose

Dignity-in-practice functions as the **structural minimum for critique under asymmetry**: restraint plus non-degradation. “Restraint” here means that interruption remains bounded to correction-relevant structure rather than becoming a vehicle for humiliation. “Non-degradation” means that critique does not use exposure, ridicule, or public fixation as a substitute for integration, coordination, or follow-up. The purpose is therefore not to soften critique, but to keep critique *structurally compatible* with correction in contexts where asymmetry makes harm easy and reversibility hard.

In this configuration, D is treated as a protection module because asymmetry creates a predictable temptation: when coordination is difficult and integration is costly, power can replace structure. The module does not deny that conflict exists or that harm exists. It clarifies how critique can remain an operation that still leaves space for correction and trajectory change instead of collapsing into degradation that forecloses both.

### 10.2 Structural Formula (PMS-Strict)

The structural signature of dignity-in-practice is given as:

**D = Ψ (self-binding) ∘ Χ (distance) ∘ Ω (asymmetry)**

This formula is not used as a rhetorical proof and not as a moral badge. It is a compact way to indicate the dependencies relevant to critique scenes. Asymmetry makes exposure and power gradients real; distance introduces stop-capability so that critique does not fuse with impulse; self-binding stabilizes restraint across time, so that restraint is not merely a momentary style but an enacted commitment that survives pressure and audience incentives.

Applied scenically, this means: dignity-in-practice is evaluated only as a property of the *interactional configuration*—how critique is enacted under asymmetry—rather than as a property of a person’s essence. The paper does not evaluate ontological dignity and does not rank beings. The clause “in-practice” is decisive: the module specifies a constraint on *how* critique proceeds, not who is “worthy.”

### 10.3 Where Critique Becomes Structurally Invalid (D Collapse)

Critique becomes structurally invalid—invalid as critique, not invalid as “speech”—when the configuration switches from correction to degradation. The canonical collapse pattern is pillory dynamics: asymmetry is converted into exposure steering, irreversibility hardens consequences, and amplification stabilizes scripts that reward humiliation over integration. In such scenes, critique does not primarily function to make a mismatch bearable and actionable; it functions to fix the target as an object of public handling.

A D collapse can be recognized structurally by the substitution pattern: integration is no longer the reachable endpoint, because the configuration has moved toward reputational fixation as the operative “resolution.” Where this happens, the critique chain may still contain framed difference and even moments of distance in the speaker, but distance is no longer serving interruption toward correction; it becomes strategic detachment that protects the acting pole while escalating exposure of the exposed pole.

The hard guard is therefore explicit and non-negotiable within this application: **dignity-in-practice never justifies humiliation, even when critique content is correct.** Correctness is a content property; humiliation is a structural operation. When humiliation becomes the steering variable, the operation is no longer critique-as-correction; it is coercion or punishment through exposure. This is precisely where the paper refuses the common drift in which “being right” is used to license degradation.

### 10.4 Where Critique Becomes Structurally Required (As Protection)

In this paper, “required” is used in a strictly structural sense: certain configurations make dignity-in-practice necessary to preserve the possibility of critique as a corrective operation. This is not moral praise and not a demand addressed to individuals. It is a statement about what must be present for the chain not to mutate under predictable load.

D becomes structurally required when **asymmetry is used as a steering variable against stop-capability**. In such scenes, exposure and positional power are mobilized to prevent interruption from becoming a genuine meta-position. The critique episode is forced into a corridor where the exposed pole cannot respond, cannot recontextualize, and cannot participate in integration. Without dignity-in-practice, critique becomes indistinguishable from asymmetric control.

D also becomes structurally required when **non-events are used as leverage**. Silence, delay, withholding, and ambiguity can become steering tools: the absence itself pressures compliance, confession, or collapse. In those configurations, critique is no longer a structured interruption aimed at correction; it becomes a game of interpretive pressure where the target is forced to move without a legible pathway to integration. D protects against this by refusing to convert non-event pressure into degradation or forced self-incrimination as a substitute for structural clarification.

Finally, D becomes structurally required when **temporal costs are externalized in ways that predictably harm the exposed pole**. Where irreversibility is high, even small exposures can become long-lived liabilities. If a critique configuration shifts lasting cost onto one side while retaining deniability for the other, the scene becomes drift-prone toward pillory logic. D is the constraint that prevents temporality from being weaponized: it keeps critique oriented toward correction trajectories rather than permanent fixation.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes dignity-in-practice as a protection condition that keeps critique structurally compatible with correction under asymmetry. The decisive point is that critique can preserve correct content while still become a different operation when it uses exposure and humiliation as substitutes for integration. Dignity-in-practice marks the boundary where critique remains oriented toward making mismatches actionable rather than fixing targets through degradation. In this chapter, dignity is treated as enacted restraint within scenes, not as an ontological claim or a ranking device. The module therefore allows the paper to describe pillory dynamics as drift without reproducing them as method.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Ω (exposure gradients):** when asymmetry is salient, critique can shift from coordination to exposure steering, distributing costs unevenly and locking the exposed pole into a vulnerable position.
- **Θ (irreversibility):** once critique becomes public fixation, consequences persist beyond the episode, and later reinterpretation cannot undo accumulated costs.
- **Α (amplification scripts):** when audiences reward degradation, scripts harden quickly and make humiliation the repeatable “resolution,” crowding out corrective integration.
- **Λ (non-event leverage):** withholding and silence can become steering tools that increase interpretive pressure and replace explicit structural clarification.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Configurations remain viable where critique can remain firm on content while staying structurally oriented toward correction rather than degradation, even under asymmetry and limited reversibility. Drift begins where exposure, irreversibility, and amplification become the steering variables that replace integration and follow-up. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** maintained by treating dignity-in-practice as a structural boundary on critique enactment, not as a demand for politeness or a judgement of character.
- **Reversibility:** interpretations remain scene-bound and revisable; accumulated harms and costs under temporality remain real and are not erased by later analysis.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** preserved by refusing shaming and ranking as critique methods and by separating correctness of content from legitimacy of degrading operations.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

Critique remains governable where restraint prevents exposure from becoming the substitute for integration and where follow-up remains structurally possible despite asymmetry. Instability arises where pillory dynamics convert critique into degradation and thereby foreclose correction trajectories. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Dignity-in-practice keeps critique corrective under asymmetry by preventing exposure and humiliation from replacing integration.

## 11. (Optional) MIP Docking Interface: Legitimacy / Attribution / Regime

*(Optional insertion; no mixing; mirrors PMS-SEX style)*

### 11.1 Purpose

This optional interface clarifies what becomes possible when PMS-CRITIQUE is docked to the *Maturity in Practice* (MIP) model. In this paper, PMS-CRITIQUE explains **how critique operates** as a praxeological chain: how a mismatch becomes legible, how interruption becomes possible, how drift forms stabilize, and how correction trajectories can (or cannot) emerge. That description remains structural and operatorial.

MIP enters at a different question-level. Where a reader needs to assess **legitimacy, attribution, and regime conditions**—especially in complex public settings where asymmetry and irreversibility are high—MIP provides an evaluative system lens without collapsing into moral shortcuts. It does so by making the evaluation criteria explicit (A/C/R/P bands, IA-box checks, optional scenic dignity-in-practice) and by requiring documentation of information basis and bias risks. The docking is therefore a controlled handoff: PMS gives the grammar of emergence and mutation; MIP supplies a regulated evaluation frame when evaluation is the explicit aim.

This chapter is optional because many uses of PMS-CRITIQUE do not require legitimacy judgments. Structural explanation often suffices to clarify why critique drifts or stalls. Docking becomes relevant where a configuration calls for *accountability distinctions* that cannot be responsibly made by PMS alone—because PMS is deliberately non-normative with respect to legitimacy, and because legitimacy claims carry their own power risks in public regimes.

### 11.2 Separation Rule (Mandatory)

The separation rule is the core of the interface and is treated as a validity condition for docking.

**PMS-CRITIQUE remains an operatorial grammar.** It describes structural dependencies, typical breakpoints, cost layouts, drift sensitivities, and viability corridors in critique episodes. It does not decide who is right, who deserves sanction, or how blame should be distributed. It stays in the mode of describing configurations.

**MIP remains an evaluative system lens.** It provides structured evaluation via A/C/R/P bands, the IA-box (transparency, justification, time-boundedness, reversibility), and—only when activated under guardrails—scenic dignity-in-practice modules. It is designed to make evaluation criteria explicit and critique-ready, not to turn evaluation into hidden moral intuition.

**No back-projection.** PMS descriptions are not retrofitted into MIP scores as if the operator grammar were itself an evaluative metric. Conversely, MIP scores and IA labels are not smuggled back into PMS as if they were causal explanations of why critique emerged or mutated. The two models can be connected, but they cannot be used to replace each other’s function without producing category errors.

**Explicit non-substitution clause.** PMS-CRITIQUE never answers whether critique is *legitimate*; it only explains how critique chains form, break, and drift. MIP never explains how critique *emerges or mutates*; it only evaluates enactments and asymmetries under explicit criteria and guardrails. If PMS is used to decide legitimacy, it becomes a hidden court. If MIP is used to explain emergence, it becomes a pseudo-causal narrative. Both moves break the discipline of the combined system.

This separation rule also protects the paper from a typical misuse pattern: using structural explanation to neutralize accountability (“it’s just structure”), or using evaluative findings to bypass structural explanation (“they are immature, therefore…”). The interface explicitly blocks both substitutions.

### 11.3 Docking Points

Docking is performed through a small set of controlled translation points. The aim is not to invent new primitives, but to clarify how a PMS description can be *projected* into MIP’s evaluative grid without implying equivalence or causal identity.

**(a) Projections from PMS into A/C/R/P/E/D readings.** PMS-CRITIQUE already introduces derived-axis projections as readable summaries of operator chains. These can be used as *inputs* for MIP-style descriptions, with the strict rule that the projection remains scene-bound and does not become a trait claim.

- **Awareness (A)** can be informed by whether framed differentiation across time is present (what is known, by whom, when, and in which role-space). In docking terms: PMS descriptions of legibility and framing can be translated into MIP’s “awareness profile” language without assuming inner-state access.
- **Coherence (C)** can be informed by whether expectation structures and narratives remain legible under non-events. PMS descriptions of non-event pressure and frame stability can be expressed as coherence conditions in MIP without turning coherence into “truth.”
- **Responsibility (R)** can be informed by whether follow-up ownership is structurally available and whether commitments can be carried across time under asymmetry. PMS descriptions of trajectory binding and cost externalization can be translated into MIP’s responsibility language without collapsing into blame.
- **Power/Agency (P)** can be informed by exposure gradients, alternatives, and the use or withholding of stop-capability in the frame. PMS descriptions of asymmetry (who can interrupt whom, and with which costs) can be translated into MIP’s power profile without implying moral guilt.
- **Action/Enactment reach (E)**—while not a core MIP parameter—can function as a bridging descriptor: whether critique reaches integrated correction (integration) or stalls in commentary. In docking, this can appear as a “correction reach” note inside the MIP case narrative rather than as a scored parameter.
- **Dignity-in-practice (D)** is the most sensitive docking point. PMS treats D as a structural protection condition for critique enactment under asymmetry. MIP can evaluate dignity-in-practice scenically only if its guardrails and application zones are met and only if the D module is explicitly activated. Docking must keep D non-ontological and strictly context-bound.

**(b) IA-box as a formal grid for asymmetry critique.** PMS-CRITIQUE describes how asymmetry (cost/exposure gradients) can replace integration and how publicness overlays can harden irreversibility. MIP’s IA-box provides a **formal evaluation grid** for such asymmetries where evaluation is required: transparency, justification, time-boundedness, and reversibility. In docking terms, PMS can supply the structural description of the asymmetry; MIP can then evaluate whether that asymmetry meets IA criteria, given an explicit information basis and bias awareness.

**(c) Regime and publicity conditions as explicit inputs.** PMS-CRITIQUE treats publicness as an amplification modulator that increases drift sensitivity. MIP operationalizes regime considerations via publicity levels, transmission checks, and red/yellow/green application zones. Docking therefore treats publicity not as a moral argument but as an explicit constraint on what kinds of evaluation are even admissible and how far results may be transmitted.

**(d) Documentation and critique-readiness as a shared constraint.** PMS insists on scene binding and reversibility; MIP requires explicit information basis, bias risks, and bands instead of hard scores. Docking is permitted only when both sides remain critique-ready: the structural explanation stays revisable, and the evaluation stays time-bounded, transparent, and non-weaponizable.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes a controlled interface between PMS-CRITIQUE and MIP by separating explanation from evaluation. The decisive point is that PMS-CRITIQUE remains a grammar of how critique chains emerge and drift, while MIP provides an explicit evaluative grid for legitimacy and attribution when evaluation is the stated aim. The interface is structured as a handoff: PMS descriptions can be projected into MIP’s parameters without becoming trait claims, and MIP’s evaluations can be applied without pretending to explain emergence. The separation rule is treated as a stability condition that prevents category errors and blocks common misuse patterns such as neutralizing accountability through “just structure” or bypassing structure through evaluative labels.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Ω (exposure gradients):** docking increases power sensitivity because evaluative language can amplify asymmetry if used as a steering tool rather than as a bounded assessment.
- **Θ (irreversibility):** once legitimacy or attribution claims are transmitted beyond the scene, revision becomes socially costly and corrections may not undo accumulated consequences.
- **Α (script costs):** repeated docking without strict separation can stabilize scripts where evaluation substitutes for explanation (“score-first” culture) or explanation substitutes for accountability (“structure-first” deflection).
- **Λ (interpretive pressure):** in contested regimes, non-events and informational gaps increase pressure to decide; docking can become a shortcut unless the information basis is explicitly bounded.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

Docking remains viable where explanation and evaluation stay explicitly separated, documentation is scene-bound and critique-ready, and transmission is constrained by publicity and reversibility conditions; drift begins where evaluation becomes a substitute for explanation or where explanation becomes a substitute for accountability. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** maintained by enforcing the separation rule so that neither model is used as a rhetorical weapon or as a substitute for the other’s function.
- **Reversibility:** both structural readings and evaluative bands remain revisable and scene-bound; nevertheless, consequences under temporality remain real once findings are transmitted.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** protected by keeping dignity assessments non-ontological, context-bound, and—on the MIP side—optional under strict guardrails and application-zone limits.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

The interface is governable where PMS-CRITIQUE supplies structural clarity and MIP supplies explicit evaluation without mutual substitution and with controlled transmission under asymmetry. Instability arises where the docking produces category errors that harden into scripts—either evaluative shortcuts that bypass structure or structural language that functions as deflection. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Docking works only when PMS explains critique’s grammar and MIP evaluates legitimacy—neither may replace the other without creating category errors.

---

## 12. Limits & Extensions (explicit non-promises)

### 12.1 Structural Limits

This framework deliberately restricts its own claims. PMS-CRITIQUE does not establish truth, verify motives, or adjudicate moral rightness. It offers no ranking of persons, no typing of “critique competence,” and no conversion of structural description into personal evaluation. The model is not designed for clinical, forensic, human-resources, compliance, or sanctioning contexts, and any attempt to repurpose it for such uses constitutes a misuse rather than an extension.

Equally important, PMS-CRITIQUE cannot be used as a delegitimization shortcut. Structural explanation does not suspend accountability by dissolving agency into “just structure.” Describing asymmetry, drift, or stabilization patterns clarifies how configurations operate; it does not dissolve the question of responsibility where responsibility was structurally available. The model therefore places limits on both inflationary moralization and deflationary structuralism.

Finally, PMS-CRITIQUE does not promise completeness. It does not exhaustively capture lived experience, subjective meaning, or normative disagreement. Its scope is the grammar of praxis under asymmetry and temporality, not the totality of social reality.

### 12.2 Extensions

Within these limits, extensions are possible but must remain explicit and modular. Domain-specific analyses—such as critique in law, science, organizations, or online publics—can be developed as separate papers that apply the same operator grammar to field-specific frames and asymmetries. Such extensions do not add new axioms; they specify domain constraints, publicity regimes, and typical drift risks.

A second extension concerns AI architecture and safety. PMS operators can be used as abstract design primitives for interrupt, reflect, integrate, and self-bind mechanisms in artificial systems, provided that no anthropomorphic claims are made. In this mode, the framework functions as a structural design vocabulary rather than a theory of mind, and dignity-in-practice remains a constraint on human-facing deployment rather than a property of machines.

All extensions remain subject to the same entry conditions: distance, reversibility, and dignity-in-practice apply to application, not to agreement. Where these conditions cannot be maintained, extension must stop.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter establishes the non-promissory boundary of PMS-CRITIQUE. The decisive point is that the framework is intentionally limited to structural clarification of critique under asymmetry and temporality, and does not expand into truth-claims, moral adjudication, or person evaluation. By making these limits explicit, the chapter protects the model against both overreach and instrumental misuse. Extensions are framed as modular and domain-bound, not as expansions of the axiomatic core, and remain governed by the same entry conditions that secure validity.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (accumulation):** ignoring stated limits allows incremental drift toward normative or evaluative use that becomes difficult to reverse once institutionalized.
- **Ω (exposure gradients):** misuse as a delegitimization tool shifts costs onto less powerful actors by masking responsibility behind structural language.
- **Α (script costs):** repeated overextension can stabilize scripts in which the model is expected to answer questions it explicitly brackets.
- **Λ (non-event load):** unaddressed expectations that the model will “decide” correctness generate interpretive pressure and disappointment over time.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

The framework remains viable where its non-promises are respected and extensions remain modular and explicit; drift begins where structural explanation is treated as verdict or where extension silently replaces the core grammar. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by refusing to let the model collapse into verdicts or personal labels, maintaining a meta-position toward its own outputs.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain scene-bound and revisable, while acknowledging that accumulated consequences under temporality cannot be undone by later disclaimers.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** maintained by excluding shaming, ranking, or ontological claims and by restricting application in high-risk zones.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

PMS-CRITIQUE is governable where its limits are treated as constitutive rather than as gaps to be filled. Instability arises where the model is stretched to answer questions it explicitly declines, or where its language is used to suspend accountability or enforce authority. This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

PMS-CRITIQUE is a grammar, not a manual: it clarifies structure and drift, not the correctness of opinions.

## 13. Conclusion

### 13.1 Structural core claims

This paper has treated critique as a praxeological configuration rather than as a moral stance, a psychological trait, or a rhetorical performance. The central move was to define critique by its minimal structural requirements and then to show how it becomes productive—or mutates into drift—under asymmetric and temporal load. What matters in this view is not the intensity of conviction, the sharpness of language, or the social prestige of the speaker, but whether a critique episode structurally contains the components that make interruption possible, keep interpretation scene-bound, and allow correction to become coordinatable.

First, critique in the strict sense is defined minimally as **χ-stabilized framed differentiation**. A mismatch must become legible as a mismatch within a frame (difference framed as relevant), and the episode must remain interruptable rather than collapsing into impulse escalation, frame policing, or aimless irritation. In this minimal configuration, **Χ (Distance)** is not decorum and not softness; it is the structural capacity for a meta-position that can stop, re-enter, and revise the reading without fusing with the impulse or the frame. Without that distance, what appears as critique tends to be reaction, judgment, or paralysis—configurations that may be socially common but are structurally distinct.

Second, productive critique is defined by a different threshold: it is not “stronger critique” but critique that reaches a corrective step. Productive critique requires **Φ (Recontextualization)** and **Σ (Integration)** on top of the minimal configuration. Recontextualization makes the mismatch bearable and actionable by shifting how it is embedded in a frame; integration consolidates what is in tension into a coherent corrective step that can be coordinated rather than merely asserted. This is where temporality and asymmetry become decisive: under **Θ (Temporality)**, consequences accumulate and review windows may close; under **Ω (Asymmetry)**, exposure and vulnerability are unevenly distributed. In such conditions, correction becomes costly, and critique often substitutes corrective integration with narrative inflation, repetition, power moves, or silence.

Third, drift is not a scandal category. Drift is the predictable mutation of critique chains under load. The paper has described typical drift classes in operator terms: reaction without distance, judgment without corrective integration, narrative repair without consolidation, commentary without correction, public pillory under amplified exposure and irreversibility, and silence stabilized as a script. Drift does not require “bad actors”; it requires configurations in which costs are redistributed in ways that make interruption fragile, recontextualization performative, and integration prohibitively expensive. In groups and publics, drift becomes especially stable because structured non-events and repeated non-intervention can harden into attractors, while publicity overlays increase exposure and accelerate stabilization without adding any new primitive capacity for correction.

Fourth, the paper has made explicit that critique has both a **vertical** and a **horizontal** dimension. Vertically, critique has reach: from mere irritation up to binding follow-up. This reach is not virtue and not status; it is a structural description of how far a chain goes before it breaks. Horizontally, critique has scale: the same operators play differently in generic structural critique, self-directed critique, small-group critique, and public critique. Publicness does not generate critique; it amplifies cost gradients and irreversibility and speeds up stabilization when critique chains break early. That amplification is structurally neutral, but it increases drift sensitivity and raises the threshold for integrated correction.

Fifth, the paper has used projections to keep the model readable without introducing new primitives. Awareness, coherence, responsibility, action, and dignity-in-practice can be treated as projections of operator chains rather than independent faculties. This mapping matters because it allows interoperability with evaluative lenses—while keeping category boundaries explicit. The point is not to “score” critique as a person attribute, but to understand which structural dimensions are being carried, which are missing, and which are being substituted.

Sixth, the paper has insisted on validity conditions for application. PMS-CRITIQUE can be discussed, criticized, rejected, or ignored without accepting its entry condition; but any *application* of its language is only valid as PMS if it presupposes **distance (Χ)**, **reversibility**, and **dignity-in-practice (D)**. This is not moral policing; it is a formal constraint to prevent the model from becoming an instrument for fusion, ranking, or humiliation. The same constraint also blocks “structural cynicism”: using structure-talk to dissolve accountability or to hide power moves behind neutral vocabulary.

In sum, PMS-CRITIQUE has offered a grammar: a way to make critique episodes structurally legible. It does not decide whose view is correct. It clarifies when interruption is structurally possible, when it becomes correction, and when it mutates into drift under the pressures of asymmetry, temporality, stabilization, and publicity.

### 13.2 Final guard sentence (citable)

> PMS-CRITIQUE does not justify opinions. It makes visible where critique becomes possible, where it mutates into drift, and why asymmetry and temporality decide whether interruption becomes correction.

### Chapter-Closure

#### (1) Structural Result (Condensation)

This chapter closes the paper by restating the structural claims in their most compact and non-promissory form. It establishes critique as a configuration defined by minimal conditions of framed differentiation and distance (Distance), rather than by rhetorical force or moral posture. It also fixes the decisive distinction between critique that remains interruptable and critique that becomes productive: productivity is treated as a structural reach toward correction rather than as intensity. Finally, the chapter consolidates the drift thesis: drift is the predictable mutation of critique chains under temporality and asymmetry, especially when repeated non-events stabilize scripts and publicness amplifies exposure without adding corrective capacity.

#### (2) Cost Distribution (Ω / Θ)

- **Θ (accumulation / irreversibility):** even “one-off” critique episodes create trajectories when their consequences accumulate; late corrections often cannot fully undo earlier effects once review windows have closed.
- **Ω (cost / exposure gradients):** critique redistributes risk unevenly; the exposed pole carries higher loss potential, which shifts what is speakable and what becomes silently absorbed.
- **Λ (non-event load / interpretive pressure):** when critique is not enacted—or is repeatedly postponed—the absence itself becomes meaningful and loads the frame with counterfactuals, suspicion, and unresolved expectation.
- **Α (script costs / narrowing):** repeated patterns of reaction, silence, or public shaming harden into scripts that narrow future options and increase drift sensitivity in subsequent episodes.

#### (3) Structural Viability Corridor

The model remains viable where critique is kept scene-bound and interruptable and where correction remains a reachable coordination step; drift begins where distance collapses into reaction, where recontextualization substitutes for integration, or where amplified exposure makes follow-up structurally unavailable. This corridor is descriptive, not prescriptive.

#### (4) Entry Guard (formal trace, explained)

- **Χ (Distance):** secured by maintaining a meta-position toward the episode—stop-capability, re-entry, and the refusal to fuse critique with impulse, identity, or frame supremacy.
- **Reversibility:** readings remain revisable and tied to specific scenes and roles, while acknowledging that accumulated costs under temporality remain real even when interpretations change.
- **D (Dignity-in-Practice):** maintained by excluding shaming, ranking, and humiliation as critique substitutes and by treating persons as out of scope for ontological evaluation.

#### (5) Structural Viability Verdict (Non-Moral)

The paper’s structure is governable where PMS-CRITIQUE is used as a grammar and not as a tribunal: it clarifies conditions, costs, and drift tendencies without turning into a correctness machine. Instability arises where the framework is used to moralize, to rank persons, or to dissolve accountability into “just structure.” This verdict evaluates structure, not persons.

#### (6) One-line Marker (quote-ready)

Critique is structurally minimal where interruption remains possible (Distance), and structurally productive only where that interruption can reach coordinated correction under asymmetry and time.

## Appendix A: Positioning Note (Misreading Firewall)

This appendix functions as a **misreading firewall**. Its purpose is to pre-emptively block predictable misinterpretations of PMS-CRITIQUE by making explicit what the model **does**, **does not**, and **cannot** claim. It is clarificatory, not justificatory.

### 1. Clarification: “Critique without moralism”

“Critique without moralism” does **not** mean critique without responsibility, consequences, or normative relevance. It means that PMS-CRITIQUE operates at the level of **structural legibility**, not moral adjudication. The framework makes visible how critique emerges, stabilizes, mutates, or collapses under specific operator configurations (Δ–Ψ), especially under asymmetry (Ω) and temporality (Θ).

What is deliberately excluded is the move from structural description to moral verdicts about persons, intentions, or worth. PMS-CRITIQUE does not excuse harmful critique, nor does it neutralize accountability. It simply refuses to ground accountability in moralized person-labels or psychological attributions. Responsibility remains structurally real, but it is traced through positions, roles, trajectories, and follow-up bindings (Ψ), not through moral character claims.

In this sense, “without moralism” means: no shortcut from irritation to condemnation, and no inflation of critique into judgment by default.

### 2. Non-comparative comparisons (descriptive only)

PMS-CRITIQUE may appear adjacent to other critique-related practices. The following comparisons are **descriptive analogies**, not evaluations, endorsements, or rejections.

**Cancel culture**
PMS-CRITIQUE does not take a position on whether cancel practices are justified or unjustified. It describes how publicness overlays (P) amplify exposure (Ω), accelerate irreversibility (Θ), and harden attractors (Α), often before distance (Χ), integration (Σ), or binding follow-up (Ψ) can stabilize correction. The framework neither condemns nor legitimizes cancellation; it renders its structural dynamics explicit.

**Therapy critique**
Unlike therapeutic critique, PMS-CRITIQUE makes no claims about inner states, motives, trauma, or psychological health. Where therapy critique often aims at personal insight or healing, PMS-CRITIQUE remains strictly praxeological: it analyzes enacted patterns, frames, and asymmetries. Similar vocabulary (e.g., reflection, interruption) does not imply shared goals or domains.

**Peer review**
Scientific peer review can be described as a highly formalized critique configuration with explicit frames (□), delayed temporality (Θ), and strong integration requirements (Σ). PMS-CRITIQUE does not assess whether peer review works well; it shows why certain failure modes (e.g., gatekeeping, silence, endless revision loops) are structurally predictable under specific operator loads.

Across all three cases, the comparison is structural, not normative.

### 3. Anti-mixing note: PMS-CRITIQUE ≠ MIP

PMS-CRITIQUE and MIP (Maturity-in-Practice) are **strictly separated systems**, even where they can be docked.

* **PMS-CRITIQUE** explains *how critique emerges, stabilizes, and drifts* using the operator grammar Δ–Ψ. It is generative, non-evaluative, and non-diagnostic.
* **MIP** evaluates *legitimacy, attribution, and responsibility* using parameters such as A–C–R–P, the IA-box, and (optionally) scenic dignity-in-practice (D).

There is **no back-projection**:

* PMS-CRITIQUE never answers whether a critique is legitimate, justified, or proportionate.
* MIP never explains how critique structurally arises or mutates.

Any exchange between the two occurs only through **explicit docking interfaces**, where the level-shift is named and constrained. Using PMS language to smuggle MIP judgments, or using MIP verdicts to retroactively explain PMS dynamics, constitutes a category error.

### 4. Negative capability: explicit non-promises

PMS-CRITIQUE intentionally does **not** provide:

* criteria for truth or falsity of claims,
* assessments of motives, sincerity, or inner states,
* rankings of critique quality or competence,
* moral authorization or delegitimization of positions,
* prescriptions for “how to critique correctly.”

These absences are not limitations to be fixed but **design boundaries**. The model’s function is to keep critique structurally intelligible under conditions of asymmetry, time, and public exposure—without collapsing into moralism, psychology, or instruction manuals.

What PMS-CRITIQUE offers is a grammar, not a verdict engine. Its negative capability is precisely what allows it to remain applicable across domains without becoming an ideology, a therapy surrogate, or a legitimacy tribunal.

## Appendix B: Operator Reference Table (Critique Lens)

**Internal purpose:**
Quick structural reference for *how* each PMS operator (Δ–Ψ) minimally functions **in the context of critique**, without re-deriving PMS or inflating operators ontologically.
The table is **diagnostic-structural**, not normative: it indicates *where critique structurally fails or drifts*, not *who is right*.

| Operator                    | Depends on | Minimal function in critique                                                        | Typical drift markers                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Δ (Difference)**          | —          | Makes a mismatch legible as “something is off” without yet assigning cause or blame | Diffuse irritation with no identifiable contrast; everything framed as “wrong” without distinction |
| **∇ (Impulse)**             | Δ          | Generates directional pressure to respond rather than remain indifferent            | Pure agitation without direction; reactive discharge detached from any corrective horizon          |
| **□ (Frame)**               | Δ, ∇       | Establishes what would count as a response, correction, or silence                  | Frame ambiguity (“nothing fits”); frame absolutization blocking any response                       |
| **Λ (Non-Event)**           | □          | Registers absence or delay of critique as structurally meaningful                   | Silence accumulation without review points; absence treated as neutral or forgotten                |
| **Α (Attractor)**           | Δ, ∇, □, Λ | Stabilizes repeated critique or non-critique patterns over time                     | Repetition without learning; script hardening independent of outcomes                              |
| **Ω (Asymmetry)**           | Α          | Shapes who can speak, who is exposed, and where costs concentrate                   | Exposure gradients without protection; responsibility diffused away from power                     |
| **Θ (Temporality)**         | Ω, Α       | Extends critique into trajectories with delay, accumulation, and irreversibility    | Endless postponement; irreversible effects without revision windows                                |
| **Φ (Recontextualization)** | Θ, Ω, □    | Shifts the frame so critique can remain bearable and actionable                     | Endless reframing without consequence; reframing used to avoid correction                          |
| **Χ (Distance)**            | Φ, Θ, □    | Keeps interruption interruptable rather than reactive or final                      | Immediate judgment; fusion of critique and verdict                                                 |
| **Σ (Integration)**         | Χ, Φ       | Synthesizes interruption into a coherent corrective step                            | Commentary without consolidation; parallel critiques never converging                              |
| **Ψ (Self-Binding)**        | Σ, Θ, Χ    | Binds critique to follow-up, ownership, and continuity over time                    | One-off critique with no accountability; withdrawal after exposure                                 |

**Note:**
This table answers *“what structurally drops out or mutates”* when critique drifts.
It does **not** evaluate legitimacy, correctness, intention, or moral standing.

---

## Appendix C: Horizontal × Vertical Matrix

**Internal purpose:**
A compact **orientation grid** that shows *where* critique typically fails or drifts when a given **operator depth** is activated at a given **scale of reach**, **without** introducing new categories, norms, or evaluative criteria.

The matrix is **purely descriptive**.
It explains *why configurations tip*, not *whether they are legitimate*.

### Axes (fixed)

**Horizontal — Scale / Reach**

* **a** — intra-situational (self / micro)
* **b** — dyadic / small group
* **c** — institutional
* **d** — public / media-amplified

**Vertical — Depth**

* **Δ → Ψ** (operator sequence; not stages, not levels of quality)

### Horizontal × Vertical Failure Matrix (typical patterns)

| Depth / Scale               | a — intra-situational                          | b — dyadic / small group                     | c — institutional                         | d — public / media-amplified                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Δ (Difference)**          | Diffuse irritation without naming what differs | Personalization of difference (“you vs. me”) | Abstract problem naming without ownership | Binary signaling; instant polarization          |
| **∇ (Impulse)**             | Rumination or self-directed agitation          | Escalation loops; reactive exchanges         | Procedural urgency without mandate        | Outrage waves detached from correction          |
| **□ (Frame)**               | Over-internalized frame (“it’s all on me”)     | Role confusion; shifting expectations        | Frame rigidity (“that’s not our remit”)   | Frame absolutization (“no discussion possible”) |
| **Λ (Non-Event)**           | Self-blame via silence                         | Passive stalemates; unspoken expectations    | Deferred responsibility normalized        | Silence interpreted as guilt or consent         |
| **Α (Attractor)**           | Habitual self-suppression or self-attack       | Recurrent conflict or avoidance scripts      | Institutional routines replacing critique | Meme-like repetition without learning           |
| **Ω (Asymmetry)**           | Inflated self-responsibility                   | Power misread as intention                   | Responsibility diffused across roles      | Exposure without protection gradients           |
| **Θ (Temporality)**         | Endless self-delay                             | Old conflicts never closing                  | Review cycles without consequence         | Irreversibility through archival spread         |
| **Φ (Recontextualization)** | Self-justifying reframes                       | Endless reframing of the relationship        | Strategic reframing without change        | Narrative spins replacing correction            |
| **Χ (Distance)**            | Over-distance: disengagement                   | Distance collapse: immediate defense         | Position defense replaces interruption    | No stop-capacity once public                    |
| **Σ (Integration)**         | Insight without enactment                      | Parallel understandings never aligned        | Reports without implementation            | Commentary accumulation without synthesis       |
| **Ψ (Self-Binding)**        | Fragile self-commitments                       | Commitments dissolve under tension           | Responsibility owned by “the system”      | One-shot critique with permanent traces         |

### Cross-cutting orientation notes

* **Low depth × high publicity (Δ / ∇ / □ at d):**
  Tends toward symbolic action, emotional amplification, and rapid polarization without correction paths.

* **Missing Χ (Distance) at c / d:**
  “Defending a position” replaces interruption; critique fuses with identity or mandate.

* **Φ (Recontextualization) without Σ (Integration) at b / c:**
  Continuous reframing stabilizes drift rather than producing correction.

* **Ψ (Self-Binding) at d:**
  High irreversibility and extreme Θ (temporality) costs; follow-up becomes structurally hard even when intentions were provisional.

**Reminder:**
This matrix does **not** rank actors, positions, or opinions.
It maps *structural failure points* that recur when certain operator–scale combinations are activated.

## Appendix D: Drift Catalogue (Compact)

**Internal purpose:**
A **compact index** of recurring drift forms already described in the paper.
Each entry names a *predictable structural mutation* of critique under operator load.

**Rule reminder:**
No drift = no accusation.
Drift = **foreseeable structural mutation**, not a character judgment.

### 1. Reaction Drift

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Δ (Difference) + ∇ (Impulse) present / Χ (Distance) absent
* **Structural description:**
  Irritation immediately discharges into reaction. Interruption collapses into expression without reflective buffering.

### 2. Judgment Drift

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  □ (Frame) + Δ present / Φ (Recontextualization) and Σ (Integration) absent / Ω (Asymmetry) leveraged
* **Structural description:**
  Framed distinctions harden into verdicts. Critique stabilizes as labeling rather than correction.

### 3. Moralization Drift

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Ω (Asymmetry) high / Χ (Distance) collapsed
* **Structural description:**
  Power or exposure gradients are translated into moral leverage. Structural asymmetry is masked as ethical certainty.

### 4. Narrative Reset Drift

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Φ (Recontextualization) high / Σ (Integration) absent
* **Structural description:**
  Reframing replaces correction. Each new narrative suspends the need for integration or follow-up.

### 5. Commentary Drift

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Χ (Distance) present / Σ (Integration) absent
* **Structural description:**
  Critique remains observational. Insight accumulates without becoming a corrective step.

### 6. Silence-as-Steering

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Λ (Non-Event) persistent / Ω (Asymmetry) unacknowledged
* **Structural description:**
  Absence of critique becomes load-bearing. Non-intervention steers outcomes without explicit responsibility.

### 7. Diffusion Drift

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Ω distributed / □ (Frame) unclear / Χ (Distance) not triggered
* **Structural description:**
  Responsibility dissolves across roles. No position activates interruption because ownership is structurally blurred.

### 8. Public Pillory

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Ω (Asymmetry) + Θ (Temporality) + Α (Attractor) under Publicness Overlay (P)
* **Structural description:**
  Exposure amplifies repetition and irreversibility. Critique stabilizes as degradation without correction paths.

### 9. Integration Bypass

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  ∇ (Impulse) + Φ (Recontextualization) present / Σ (Integration) bypassed
* **Structural description:**
  Movement occurs without synthesis. Action fragments into disconnected responses.

### 10. Commitment Evasion

* **Minimal operator signature:**
  Σ (Integration) partial / Ψ (Self-Binding) absent
* **Structural description:**
  Even integrated insights remain non-binding. Critique does not attach to trajectory ownership.

**Orientation note:**
This catalogue is **diagnostic-structural**, not normative.
It identifies *how critique mutates*, not *who is right*.

## Appendix E: One-page Structural Map

**Internal purpose:**
Provide a **single-page structural orientation** for readers who do not want to re-parse the entire paper, without collapsing PMS-CRITIQUE into a linear process model.

### Structural Core (fixed)

The map displays the full **operator field** used in PMS-CRITIQUE as a single structural horizon:

**Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ → Ψ**

This sequence represents **logical dependency**, not temporal order.
Operators do not “fire” one after another; they **co-structure** critique configurations.

### Conceptual Emphasis (foreground operators)

The map explicitly highlights four operators as **structural pivots** for critique viability:

* **Χ (Distance):**
  Marks the difference between interruption and reaction. Without Χ, critique collapses into impulse discharge or judgment.

* **Φ (Recontextualization):**
  Enables critique to shift frames without denial or erasure. Φ makes critique *bearable* rather than merely oppositional.

* **Σ (Integration):**
  Turns interruption and reframing into a corrective step. Without Σ, critique remains commentary or narrative movement.

* **Ψ (Self-Binding):**
  Anchors critique across time. Ψ distinguishes critique that “lands” from critique that evaporates after expression.

These operators are not “higher” in value, but **higher in structural leverage** for avoiding drift.

### Structural Overlays (non-operatorial)

The map includes three **transparent overlays** that modulate the entire field:

* **Ω (Asymmetry):**
  Cuts across the structure as exposure, power, or responsibility gradients. Ω shapes *who* can interrupt whom and at what cost.

* **Θ (Temporality):**
  Extends configurations into trajectories. Θ determines accumulation, irreversibility, and delayed consequences of critique or non-critique.

* **Publicness Overlay (P):**
  A non-operatorial amplification layer.
  P does **not** generate critique. It intensifies:

  * Ω (exposure gradients),
  * Θ (irreversibility),
  * Α (stabilization speed of scripts).

Publicness increases **drift sensitivity** without implying that publicity is inherently negative.

### Reading Instructions (anti-misuse)

* This map is **not a flowchart**.
* It does **not** imply:

  * “first Δ, then ∇, then …”
  * developmental stages,
  * competence ladders.
* Any subset of operators may dominate a given scene.
* Absence, overload, or collapse of a single operator is sufficient to explain many critique failures.

### Function of the Map

The one-page structural map serves as:

* a **navigation aid**, not an explanation,
* a **memory scaffold** for the paper’s logic,
* a **drift-orientation tool**: readers can locate *where* a configuration collapses without assigning blame.

It visualizes PMS-CRITIQUE as a **structural field**, not as a method, manual, or moral theory.
