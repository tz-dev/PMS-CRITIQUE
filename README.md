# PMS–CRITIQUE

## From Irritation to Correction: A Praxeological Grammar of Critique (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–CRITIQUE is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–CRITIQUE reconstructs *critique itself* as a **structurally constrained praxis form**: how irritation becomes interruptible, how critique mutates under load, and why correction requires more than expression, judgment, or exposure.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* why critique is not an attitude but a **χ-stabilized interruption**,
* how critique mutates into reaction, judgment, narrative reset, silence, or exposure under load,
* how **asymmetry (Ω)** and **temporality (Θ)** redistribute costs even when “nothing happens,”
* why recontextualization (Φ) without integration (Σ) produces analytic drift,
* and why durable critique requires **self-binding (Ψ)** without becoming coercive.

In this sense, PMS–CRITIQUE should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on structural legibility rather than moral or psychological evaluation**.

## What PMS–CRITIQUE Is

PMS–CRITIQUE is:

* A **praxeological grammar of critique** (not a discourse ethics)
* A **PMS_1.1–conform application** of the operator set (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for analysing:
  * critique as **interruptible differentiation** (Δ under □ with Χ)
  * drift forms where critique mutates into substitutes
  * **non-event load (Λ)** and silence as structural outcomes
  * **scale effects** (a–d) and publicness amplification (P)
  * the roles of **Φ / Χ / Σ / Ψ** in turning interruption into correction
* A viability model that evaluates critique by:
  * **operator carriage** (what carries coordination vs. what substitutes)
  * **reversibility and restraint** (Χ / D constraints in application)
  * **structural costs** (Ω / Θ accumulation, exposure gradients)
  * rather than moral correctness or rhetorical force

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-moral in description /  
> Operator-strict in analysis /  
> Guardrailed in application**

## What PMS–CRITIQUE Is *Not*

PMS–CRITIQUE is not:

* A theory of “good discourse” or conversational virtue
* A psychological account of motives, traits, or sincerity
* A coaching, mediation, or therapy method
* A framework for ranking speakers, blaming actors, or enforcing outcomes
* A justification tool for shaming, pile-ons, or irreversible exposure

PMS–CRITIQUE treats critique as a **praxis configuration** —  
not as courage, honesty, moral clarity, or tone.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–CRITIQUE argues that:

* Critique in the strict sense requires **distance (Χ)** as interruptability, not politeness.
* Expression, judgment, explanation, or silence are **not weaker critique**, but structurally different outcomes.
* Drift is **predictable** when critique pressure is handled without integration (Σ) or binding (Ψ).
* Costs accumulate even under non-events (Λ), especially under asymmetry (Ω) and time (Θ).
* Publicness (P) does not change critique grammar — it **amplifies drift sensitivity**.

> Critique begins where a mismatch becomes interruptible —  
> correction begins where interruption is integrated and bound.

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–CRITIQUE is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in  
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)  
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* All claims remain **scene-bound, reversible, and non-diagnostic**

Where PMS provides the **grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–CRITIQUE specifies how that grammar behaves when applied to:

* irritation and mismatch (Δ),
* interruption and distance (Χ),
* scale and exposure (Ω / Θ),
* drift substitution (Λ / Α / Φ),
* and correction viability (Σ / Ψ).

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The repository includes a dedicated **Example Suite** (`/examples`) consisting of five structurally uniform case mappings.

These examples are **not illustrations, prescriptions, or moral verdicts**.  
They function as **operator-legible scene packets** that stress-test critique under load.

Each example:

* models a **high-misread-risk situation** (where moralization is common),
* applies a **reduced operator signature** (not a proof chain),
* separates **roles, frames, costs, and trajectories** from persons,
* enforces the **PMS application gate**: Χ + reversibility + D.

Included examples:

1. **The Missing Reply Becomes the Story**  
   *Non-event load and silence attractors in small groups.*

2. **Fast Outrage, No Stop-Capability**  
   *Reaction masquerading as critique under public exposure.*

3. **Endless Reframing Meeting**  
   *Narrative reset drift: Φ without Σ.*

4. **Policy Without Follow-Up**  
   *Integration without self-binding; symbolic correction.*

5. **Role Asymmetry Turns “Feedback” Into Exposure**  
   *Judgment drift under evaluative asymmetry.*

The Example Suite trains **structural reading discipline**:
how to keep critique legible without collapsing into advice or blame.

## Intended Use

PMS–CRITIQUE is intended for:

* Structural theorists analysing critique and drift
* Governance, media, and institutional analysts
* Researchers working on asymmetry, exposure, and irreversibility
* Readers seeking a **non-moral, non-clinical** language for critique failure

It is **not** intended for coercive application, person-ranking, or prescriptive enforcement.

Any application must respect the **PMS entry condition**:
**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**.

---

## Final Note

PMS–CRITIQUE does not tell you who is right.

It explains why critique so often fails *even when intentions are good* —
and why interruption, without integration and binding, mutates into drift.

> Critique is not lost by disagreement —
> it is lost when interruption cannot stay interruptible.
