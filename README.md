# PMS–CRITIQUE

## From Irritation to Correction: A Praxeological Grammar of Critique (Δ–Ψ)

**PMS–CRITIQUE is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, and self-binding.

While PMS provides the **canonical operator grammar** for analysing action and non-action, PMS–CRITIQUE reconstructs *critique itself* as a **structurally constrained praxis form**: how irritation becomes interruptible, how critique mutates under load, and why correction requires more than expression, judgment, or exposure.

Building explicitly on PMS as its structural foundation, this project does **not modify or extend the PMS operator set**, but uses it **strictly as specified** to show:

* why critique is not an attitude but a **χ-stabilized interruption**,
* how critique mutates into reaction, judgment, narrative reset, silence, or exposure under load,
* how **asymmetry (Ω)** and **temporality (Θ)** redistribute costs even when “nothing happens,”
* why recontextualization (Φ) without integration (Σ) produces analytic drift,
* and why durable critique requires **self-binding (Ψ)** without becoming coercive.

In this sense, PMS–CRITIQUE should be read as:

* **conceptually dependent on PMS**,
* **formally consistent with the PMS operator grammar**, and
* **focused on structural legibility rather than moral or psychological evaluation**.

## What PMS–CRITIQUE Is

PMS–CRITIQUE is:

* A **praxeological grammar of critique** (not a discourse ethics)
* A **PMS_1.1–conform application** of the operator set (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for analysing:

  * critique as **interruptible differentiation** (Δ under □ with Χ)
  * drift forms where critique mutates into substitutes
  * **non-event load (Λ)** and silence as structural outcomes
  * **scale effects** (a–d) and publicness amplification (P)
  * the roles of **Φ / Χ / Σ / Ψ** in turning interruption into correction
* A viability model that evaluates critique by:

  * **operator carriage** (what carries coordination vs. what substitutes)
  * **reversibility and restraint** (Χ / D constraints in application)
  * **structural costs** (Ω / Θ accumulation, exposure gradients)
  * rather than moral correctness or rhetorical force

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-moral in description /
> Operator-strict in analysis /
> Guardrailed in application**

## What PMS–CRITIQUE Is *Not*

PMS–CRITIQUE is not:

* A theory of “good discourse” or conversational virtue
* A psychological account of motives, traits, or sincerity
* A coaching, mediation, or therapy method
* A framework for ranking speakers, blaming actors, or enforcing outcomes
* A justification tool for shaming, pile-ons, or irreversible exposure

PMS–CRITIQUE treats critique as a **praxis configuration** —
not as courage, honesty, moral clarity, or tone.

---

## Core Thesis

PMS–CRITIQUE argues that:

* Critique in the strict sense requires **distance (Χ)** as interruptability, not politeness.
* Expression, judgment, explanation, or silence are **not weaker critique**, but structurally different outcomes.
* Drift is **predictable** when critique pressure is handled without integration (Σ) or binding (Ψ).
* Costs accumulate even under non-events (Λ), especially under asymmetry (Ω) and time (Θ).
* Publicness (P) does not change critique grammar — it **amplifies drift sensitivity**.

> Critique begins where a mismatch becomes interruptible —
> correction begins where interruption is integrated and bound.

---

## Relation to PMS

PMS–CRITIQUE is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No new operators are introduced
* No operator is redefined
* All dependency rules are respected
* All claims remain **scene-bound, reversible, and non-diagnostic**

Where PMS provides the **grammar of praxis**,
PMS–CRITIQUE specifies how that grammar behaves when applied to:

* irritation and mismatch (Δ),
* interruption and distance (Χ),
* scale and exposure (Ω / Θ),
* drift substitution (Λ / Α / Φ),
* and correction viability (Σ / Ψ).

## What You Can Do With PMS.yaml + PMS-CRITIQUE.yaml (That PMS Alone Does Not Provide)

PMS.yaml gives you the **canonical operator system** (Δ–Ψ), dependency hygiene, derived axes (where present), and general governance constraints for structural (non-psychological) reading.

PMS-CRITIQUE.yaml adds a **domain-specific application profile** for *critique* that makes several things **explicitly computable / recordable / comparable** across cases and analysts:

### 1) Critique thresholds (strict, operator-readable)

PMS-CRITIQUE defines three explicit thresholds:

* **CRITIQUE_MIN** = Δ + □ + Χ
* **CRITIQUE_PROD** = Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ
* **CRITIQUE_STABLE** = Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ + Ψ

With PMS alone, you can *describe* these chains; with PMS-CRITIQUE you can **treat them as named structural checkpoints** and use them as stable reference points across tooling, cases, and papers.

### 2) A vertical reach ladder (V0–V4)

PMS-CRITIQUE introduces a standardized **reach axis** for critique episodes:

* V0 irritation only (Δ)
* V1 reaction/discharge (Δ + ∇)
* V2 minimal critique (Δ + □ + Χ)
* V3 productive critique (… + Φ + Σ)
* V4 stable critique (… + Ψ)

This lets you record *where a critique chain breaks* without sliding into moral verdicts (“bad discourse”) or person-typing.

### 3) A horizontal scale ladder (paper tags a–d) + optional deployment tags

PMS-CRITIQUE specifies **scale as a formal scene descriptor** that determines where Ω/Θ stabilize:

* a) generic/structural (no actor binding)
* b) single-subject (self/support/learning)
* c) small group (peers/team/family)
* d) public (street/media/online)

It also provides optional **deployment tags** for tooling/repo convenience while keeping the paper tags canonical.

### 4) Drift typology (predictable substitutions under load)

PMS-CRITIQUE formalizes critique failure modes as **operator-readable drift classes** (D1–D6 + compact catalogue), e.g.:

* reaction masquerading as critique (Δ + ∇ / Χ absent)
* judgment masquerading as critique (□ + Δ / Φ, Σ absent)
* narrative reset drift (Φ high / Σ absent)
* public pillory (Ω + Θ + Α under P)
* silence attractor (Λ → Α under Ω/Θ)

With PMS alone, you can describe these as patterns; PMS-CRITIQUE makes them **named, repeatable descriptors** for consistent annotation and comparison.

### 5) Publicness overlay P (amplification without new structure)

PMS-CRITIQUE introduces **P** as an explicit overlay that amplifies Ω/Θ/Α without changing operator grammar—crucial for separating “bad discourse” explanations from **amplification dynamics**.

### 6) Modulators (operator weightings, not person-typing)

PMS-CRITIQUE adds modulators (M1–M8) as a *non-typing* way to express why a scene is drift-sensitive:

* frame clarity, non-event density, temporal compression, distance availability, attractor inertia, etc.

### 7) Optional example packet schema for uniform case mappings

PMS-CRITIQUE provides an **instance-facing schema** for cases (“scene packets”) that preserves the entry gate (Χ + reversibility + D) and keeps outputs comparable.

In short:

> PMS is the operator grammar.
> PMS-CRITIQUE is the critique profile: thresholds + axes + drift + overlays + case schema.

## PMS-CRITIQUE YAML (Addon Specification)

This repository includes (or is meant to include) **PMS-CRITIQUE.yaml** as an addon specification:

* It **DEPENDS on PMS_1.1** and references Δ–Ψ strictly.
* It defines critique thresholds, reach/scale axes, drift typology, modulators, and guardrails.
* It explicitly separates:

  * **operator grammar** (PMS)
  * from **application profile** (PMS-CRITIQUE)

### Minimal “scene packet” skeleton (for tooling / uniform mappings)

```yaml
scene_label: "Example: missing reply in a team thread"
frame_anchor (□): "team coordination thread"
trigger_mismatch (Δ): "expected update does not arrive"
operator_signature: ["□","Δ","Λ","Ω","Θ","Α"]   # reduced signature, not proof
guardrail_gate: "Χ + reversibility + D"
structural_closure: >
  The non-event accumulates load because expectations exist inside the frame.
  Exposure costs discourage interruption, so silence stabilizes as script.
  The reading remains scene-bound and reversible; no person-typing is implied.
scale:
  system: "paper_tags"
  tag: "c"
reach_level: "V2"
drift_class: "D6"
modulators: ["M1","M2","M3","M7"]
publicness_overlay (P) note: "absent"
```

This packet format is optional, but it is designed to make case mappings **uniform, reversible, and non-moral**.

---

## Model Specification (Human-Readable)

Alongside the YAML, this repo also contains (or is meant to contain) a **human-readable model specification** (HTML/PDF) that:

* explains the YAML structure in technical prose,
* makes the axes (reach/scale) and drift catalogue legible to readers,
* and clarifies guardrails and non-goals.

If you are reading PMS-CRITIQUE for the first time, the intended reading order is:

1. PMS base grammar (PMS.yaml)
2. PMS-CRITIQUE.yaml (thresholds + axes + drift + overlays)
3. Paper text (“From Irritation to Correction”)
4. Example Suite (stress tests)

---

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The repository includes a dedicated **Example Suite** (`/examples`) consisting of five structurally uniform case mappings.

These examples are **not illustrations, prescriptions, or moral verdicts**.
They function as **operator-legible scene packets** that stress-test critique under load.

Each example:

* models a **high-misread-risk situation** (where moralization is common),
* applies a **reduced operator signature** (not a proof chain),
* separates **roles, frames, costs, and trajectories** from persons,
* enforces the **PMS application gate**: Χ + reversibility + D.

Included examples:

1. **The Missing Reply Becomes the Story**
   *Non-event load and silence attractors in small groups.*

2. **Fast Outrage, No Stop-Capability**
   *Reaction masquerading as critique under public exposure.*

3. **Endless Reframing Meeting**
   *Narrative reset drift: Φ without Σ.*

4. **Policy Without Follow-Up**
   *Integration without self-binding; symbolic correction.*

5. **Role Asymmetry Turns “Feedback” Into Exposure**
   *Judgment drift under evaluative asymmetry.*

The Example Suite trains **structural reading discipline**:
how to keep critique legible without collapsing into advice or blame.

## Intended Use

PMS–CRITIQUE is intended for:

* Structural theorists analysing critique and drift
* Governance, media, and institutional analysts
* Researchers working on asymmetry, exposure, and irreversibility
* Readers seeking a **non-moral, non-clinical** language for critique failure

It is **not** intended for coercive application, person-ranking, or prescriptive enforcement.

Any application must respect the **PMS entry condition**:
**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**.

---

## Final Note

PMS–CRITIQUE does not tell you who is right.

It explains why critique so often fails *even when intentions are good* —
and why interruption, without integration and binding, mutates into drift.

> Critique is not lost by disagreement —
> it is lost when interruption cannot stay interruptible.
