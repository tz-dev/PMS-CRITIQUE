			<h1><strong>PMS-CRITIQUE</strong></h1>
			<h2><em>Example 4: Policy Without Follow-Up</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Formal Synthesis vs. Missing Trajectory Ownership</em>
			<strong>Scale:</strong> c) Institutional
			<strong>Overlay:</strong> No publicness overlay (P inactive)
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No evaluation of policy quality, intent, or competence. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>
			Organizational response following a documented failure.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame anchor):</strong>
			Institutional policy-making frame: drafting, approval, publication, training.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Initial response phase followed by months of operational time without checkpoints.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (structural, not personal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: policy authors / approvers.</li>
			<li>Role R₂: implementers subject to the guideline.</li>
			<li>No role explicitly bound to longitudinal ownership.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ / ∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong>
			Gap between intended standards and observed failure becomes legible.</li>
			<li><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong>
			Pressure to demonstrate resolution through formal articulation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Expected but missing events (Λ candidates):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Scheduled review or audit.</li>
			<li>Feedback loop tied to observed practice.</li>
			<li>Assignment of responsibility across time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A coherent guideline is produced and communicated.</li>
			<li>Initial attention and training occur.</li>
			<li>No follow-up mechanisms materialize.</li>
			<li>Over time, reference to the policy becomes ritualized.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Readability Aid)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Σ (Integration – synthesis achieved):</strong>
			The guideline coherently integrates multiple concerns into a single statement.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ψ (Self-Binding – weak or absent):</strong>
			No durable commitment structure binds roles to the guideline across time.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality – unowned trajectory):</strong>
			Without time-bound checkpoints, the policy drifts out of operational relevance.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Λ (Non-Event – meaningful absence):</strong>
			The lack of follow-up becomes informative: “nothing happens after publication.”</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Attractor – script stabilization):</strong>
			“We have a policy” stabilizes as the default response to recurrence.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Dependency hygiene note:</strong>
			No standalone claims about responsibility or maturity are made. Absence of <strong>Ψ</strong> here names missing structural binding, not motivational failure.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Drift Classification</h3>
			<p><strong>Drift class:</strong> Symbolic integration drift</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal drift signature:</strong>
			<strong>Σ present / Ψ absent</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Observable drift markers (non-moral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Statement exists without time-indexed ownership.</li>
			<li>Reference to the policy substitutes for enacted correction.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Each unreviewed month increases the gap between policy and practice.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Script narrowing):</strong>
			Policy production becomes the recognized endpoint of response.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry):</strong>
			Implementation burden diffuses downward, while binding authority remains unlocated.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Λ (Non-event load):</strong>
			Absence of follow-up signals low consequence for non-alignment.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following behaviors are <strong>structurally rational</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Treating the guideline as symbolic rather than operative.</li>
			<li>Referencing policy existence to close discussions.</li>
			<li>Delaying alignment because no temporal enforcement signal appears.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These responses follow from <strong>Σ without Ψ across Θ</strong>, not from disregard or resistance.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>
			Dignity-in-practice is strained when responsibility is implied but never structurally owned, shifting exposure without binding protection.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>
			The system avoids coercion but also avoids commitment, leaving enactment unsupported.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader Guard / Validity Gate</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that policies are ineffective,</li>
			<li>that authors acted insincerely,</li>
			<li>that enforcement is morally required,</li>
			<li>that failure implies incompetence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that integration without self-binding does not generate durable change,</li>
			<li>that time requires ownership to remain corrective,</li>
			<li>that policy can stabilize as symbol when follow-up is structurally absent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any use of this analysis for blame or prescription violates PMS validity conditions (<strong>Χ, reversibility, D</strong>).</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>In this configuration, critique reaches synthesis but not commitment. Integration produces a clear statement, yet without self-binding it does not become a trajectory. Over time, absence of follow-up teaches the organization how seriously the policy is meant to be taken. What persists is not confusion, but a stable symbolic equilibrium: the guideline exists, the failure recurs, and reference replaces responsibility. The drift stabilizes where <strong>Σ is decoupled from Ψ across Θ</strong>, allowing coherence without consequence.</p>
