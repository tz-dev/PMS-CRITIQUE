#  Last Updated:   2026-01-07
#
#  Summary:
#    This document defines PMS-CRITIQUE as a structural application layer of
#    the Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS; Δ–Ψ). It treats "critique" as a
#    praxeological configuration with strict minimal conditions, reachable
#    thresholds, and predictable drift forms under load (Ω/Θ/Λ/Α), while
#    enforcing a non-moral, non-clinical application firewall:
#      Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice).
#
#    PMS-CRITIQUE does NOT redefine or extend the PMS operator set. It maps
#    Δ–Ψ to critique-relevant functions (irritation, interruption, correction,
#    follow-up binding) and provides:
#      - operator mappings (Δ–Ψ → critique roles),
#      - a vertical reach ladder (irritation → interruption → correction → binding),
#      - a horizontal scale ladder (a–d) plus a publicness overlay P,
#      - a compact drift typology (reaction/judgment/narrative reset/etc.),
#      - modulators (operator weightings, not person-typing),
#      - an example packet schema for uniform case mappings.
#
#  Relationship to PMS:
#    - DEPENDS on PMS base schema (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#    - Δ–Ψ operators are NOT redefined here.
#    - This is an application grammar for critique and its drift under load.

  description: >
    PMS-CRITIQUE is a PMS-conform application layer that reconstructs critique as a
    structurally constrained praxis form: how mismatch becomes interruptible
    (Χ-stabilization), how critique becomes productive (Φ + Σ), and why durable
    correction requires non-coercive self-binding (Ψ). The layer provides
    operator mappings, reach/scale ladders, drift classes, and modulators, while
    enforcing a strict non-moral, non-clinical application gate:
    Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice).

pms_reference:
  note: >
    PMS-CRITIQUE assumes the PMS core specification is available and does not
    redefine any operator (Δ–Ψ) or dependency rule. All elements below are
    mappings, patterns, and application guardrails expressed at the operator level.
  operators_ref:
    source: "PMS.yaml"
    schema_version: "PMS_1.1"
    meta_axioms: ["Δ", "∇", "□", "Λ", "Α", "Ω", "Θ", "Φ", "Χ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
  dependency_hygiene:
    chi_note: >
      Χ (Distance) is used as a reduced marker for critique interruptability.
      In PMS terms it presupposes Φ (Recontextualization) and Θ (Temporality)
      within a □ (Frame) background; it is not treated as a standalone trait.
    no_operator_override: >
      Any operator gloss in this file is an application-facing excerpt only.
      Canonical operator definitions and dependencies remain in PMS.yaml.

critique_core:
  scope_note: >
    PMS-CRITIQUE models structural conditions of critique and its drift under load.
    It does not adjudicate correctness of opinions and does not provide normative discourse ethics.
  definitions:
    - id: "CRITIQUE_MIN"
      label: "Minimal Critique"
      formula:
        required: ["Δ", "□", "Χ"]
        background_typically_active: ["Ω", "Θ"]
      gloss: >
        Minimal critique is χ-stabilized framed differentiation: a mismatch (Δ)
        becomes legible as relevant inside a frame (□), and the configuration remains
        interruptible (Χ) rather than collapsing into impulse discharge, frame policing,
        or paralysis.
      non_equivalences:
        - "Reaction (Δ + ∇ without Χ) is not a weaker critique; it is structurally different."
        - "Judgment (□ + Δ without Φ/Σ) is not 'strong critique'; it is a drift form."

    - id: "CRITIQUE_PROD"
      label: "Productive Critique"
      formula:
        required: ["Δ", "□", "Χ", "Φ", "Σ"]
        background_typically_active: ["Ω", "Θ"]
      gloss: >
        Productive critique crosses from interruption into correction. Φ relocates the mismatch
        into an actionable context; Σ consolidates a coherent corrective step that is coordinatable
        rather than merely asserted.

    - id: "CRITIQUE_STABLE"
      label: "Stable Critique (Follow-up Binding)"
      formula:
        required: ["Δ", "□", "Χ", "Φ", "Σ", "Ψ"]
        background_typically_active: ["Ω", "Θ"]
      gloss: >
        Stable critique binds correction into a trajectory without coercing others (Ψ→Self).
        Follow-up becomes structurally owned over time (Θ) while remaining revisable and
        restrained by dignity-in-practice (D).

  non_goals:
    - "No moral ranking of positions, speakers, or outcomes."
    - "No psychological typing (motives, traits, sincerity) and no diagnostic claims."
    - "No prescriptive 'how-to' manual, coaching protocol, or therapy method."
    - "No coercive enforcement: Ψ must not be converted into Ψ→Other demands."

  reach_ladder_note: >
    The vertical reach ladder is not a virtue ladder. It describes how far a critique chain
    structurally travels (from mismatch to interruption to correction to binding) before breaking.

# OPERATOR-TO-CRITIQUE MAPPING (ONE-TO-MANY)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

critique_mapping:
  overview: >
    Operator-to-critique mappings are one-to-many: each PMS operator may realize
    multiple critique-relevant functions depending on frame and scale. This mapping
    is descriptive and does not treat operators as psychological traits.

        Exposure gradients: who bears risk, reputational cost, retaliation risk,
        and after-work of critique/correction.
      typical_realizations:
        - "Public target vs. diffuse crowd."
        - "Junior exposed under senior correction."

        - "Repeated non-follow-up hardens silence norm."

    - id: "Φ"
      name: "Recontextualization"
      critique_role: >
        Reframing that can either bridge toward correction (Φ with Σ) or become a

      typical_realizations:
        - "Legitimate pauses and renegotiations."
        - "Non-penalized meta-positions ('let's stop and clarify')."

        Consolidation of a corrective step that is coherent enough to coordinate:

# AXES: REACH (VERTICAL) AND SCALE (HORIZONTAL) + PUBLICNESS OVERLAY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

critique_axes:
  overview: >
    PMS-CRITIQUE uses two descriptive axes: (1) vertical reach (how far a critique chain
    goes before it breaks) and (2) horizontal scale (a–d), plus a publicness overlay P
    that amplifies Ω/Θ/Α without changing operator grammar.

  vertical_reach:
    note: "Reach is structural, not virtue, status, or moral rank."

        description: "Follow-up binding anchors correction into time without coercion."

  horizontal_scale:
    note: >
      Horizontal scale specifies where asymmetry (Ω: exposure gradients) and temporality (Θ: accumulation
      and irreversibility) stabilize across scene scale. The operator grammar remains the same, but
      viability conditions (Χ-availability, Σ-costs, Ψ-feasibility) change with scale.
    systems:
      paper_tags:
        note: >
          Canonical scale system (Chapter 5). These tags are defined by actor-binding and where Ω/Θ stabilize,
          not by surface size alone.
        tags:
          a:
            label: "a) Generic / Structural Critique (No Actor Binding)"
            description: >
              Critique is treated as formal structural possibility (operator movement only).
              No actor, role, or scene is bound. Ω/Θ appear only as abstract parameters.
              Analytically clean, practically incomplete: critique exists as grammar, not as risk-bearing praxis.
            reference: "CRITIQUE_MIN and CRITIQUE_PROD as pure structure, without actor binding."
          b:
            label: "b) Single-Subject Critique (Self / Support / Learning)"
            description: >
              Critique is inwardly bound: the subject occupies both poles (interrupts and bears consequences).
              Ω is internalized; Χ must be self-generated unless scaffolded. Ψ is optional but decisive for durable
              trajectory change.
            typical_drifts:
              - "Under-questioning (Δ acknowledged but not framed)."
              - "Over-framing (context inflation)."
              - "Φ without Σ (recontextualization inflation)."
              - "Avoidance of Σ due to anticipated self-exposure costs."
          c:
            label: "c) Small Group Critique (Peers / Team / Family)"
            description: >
              Critique becomes relational. Ω is distributed across roles; Χ is harder because interruption affects
              belonging and status. Λ becomes central: non-intervention is legible and accumulates. Repeated Λ stabilizes
              Α scripts (joking, indirect shaming, 'we don't say things'). Responsibility diffusion is structural, not a
              character failure.
            typical_drifts:
              - "Λ → Α silence script."
              - "Judgment drift in evaluative micro-hierarchies."
              - "Diffusion drift via unclear role space."
          d:
            label: "d) Public Critique (Street / Media / Online)"
            description: >
              Maximal amplification: Ω gradients steep, Θ hardens irreversibility, Α stabilizes quickly.
              Χ becomes fragile under visibility/performance pressure. Σ is costly (permanent contestability),
              Ψ is rare and often substituted by performative alignment signals.
            typical_drifts:
              - "Reaction drift under time pressure."
              - "Public pillory (exposure-as-substitute)."
              - "Bystander paralysis → Λ persistence → silence attractor."
        chapter_marker_quote_ready: >
          The operators stay the same, but scale decides the cost: as critique moves into publicness,
          exposure and irreversibility amplify drift without adding new structure.

      deployment_tags:
        note: >
          Optional convenience tags for tooling and repositories. These do not replace paper_tags.
          They describe common scene families. A case may carry both a deployment_tag and a paper_tag.
        tags:
          dyadic_micro:
            label: "dyadic / micro"
            description: "Small, direct interaction."

    interoperability:
      note: >
        Backward compatibility: if a case uses a single 'scale_tag: a|b|c|d', it SHOULD be treated as paper_tags by default.
        Tooling MAY additionally accept deployment_tags via an explicit system selector.
      defaults:

  publicness_overlay:
    id: "P"
    type: "overlay_modulator"
    description: >
      Publicness is an amplification overlay (not an operator). It amplifies Ω (exposure gradients),
      hardens Θ (irreversibility), and accelerates Α (script stabilization) without creating critique
      or correction by itself.

# GUARDRAILS (ENTRY CONDITION + MISUSE FIREWALL)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

guardrails:
  application_gate:
    required:
      - "The PMS entry condition (Χ + reversibility + D) is a validity constraint on PMS-application, not on critique or rejection."
      - "Χ (Distance) remains practically activatable (stop-capability is real, not merely formal)."
      - "Reversibility: readings remain scene-bound and revisable; Θ accumulation is treated as real."
      - "D (Dignity-in-Practice): no shaming, humiliation, or actor-ranking; critique stays structural."
    disallowed_uses:
      - "Person-labeling, motive attribution, psychological diagnosis."
      - "Verdict logic ('who is right') as an output of the model."
      - "Coercive binding (Ψ→Other), threats, or exposure-as-punishment."
      - "Using drift labels as sanctions rather than as structural descriptors."
  dignity_in_practice:
    note: >
      D constrains application mode, not content: analysis must not become a pile-on,
      and must preserve restraint even when Ω/P are high.
  misuse_signatures_to_flag:
    - "Using χ-language to demand compliance (χ as coercion)."
    - "Treating public exposure as correction (P substituted for Σ/Ψ)."
    - "Turning drift labels into moral rank tokens."
    - "Collapsing scene-bounded critique into person-typing."
    - "Using drift language to justify irreversible binding demands."

# EXAMPLE PACKETS (OPTIONAL; INSTANCE-FACING)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

example_suite:
  overview: >
    Example packets are operator-legible vignettes designed to keep critique and drift readable
    without instruction, diagnosis, or moral ranking. They are optional and illustrative; they do not
    define critique semantics.
  packet_schema:
    required_fields:
      - "scene_label"
      - "frame_anchor (□)"
      - "trigger_mismatch (Δ)"
      - "operator_signature (reduced; 2–6 operators)"
      - "guardrail_gate (Χ + reversibility + D reminder)"
      - "structural_closure (2–5 plain sentences; non-instructional)"
      - "scale"
    scale:
      required:
        - "system"
        - "tag"
      allowed_systems: ["paper_tags", "deployment_tags"]
      legacy_support:

      - "Operator mapping is a readability aid, not a proof chain."
      - "No advice; no 'should'; no enforcement language."

  repository_examples:
    note: >
      Repository examples may exist, but PMS-CRITIQUE does not depend on them.
      They are provided only as optional training material for structural reading discipline.

# LOAD ORDER + META NOTES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

load_order:
  note: >
    PMS-CRITIQUE is designed as an addon layer (mapping + patterns), not a replacement.
    It should be loaded after the PMS base grammar.
  order:
    - "PMS.yaml"
    - "PMS-CRITIQUE.yaml"
    - "pms-critique-ext.yaml (optional; paper-specific additions)"

meta_notes:
  compatibility:
    - "This layer is PMS_1.1-conform and does not add new operators."
    - "All constructs are mappable to Δ–Ψ signatures and scene-bound records."
  extensibility:
    - "Future versions MAY add optional paper-specific extensions (macros, templates, policies) without overriding this base layer."
  neutrality:
    - "All mappings remain structural; no psychologizing, moral ranking, or prescriptive claims are encoded."
