			<h1><strong>PMS-CRITIQUE</strong></h1>
			<h2><em>Example 2: Fast Outrage, No Stop-Capability</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>High Expressive Intensity vs. Missing Interruption</em>
			<strong>Scale:</strong> d) Public / media-amplified
			<strong>Overlay:</strong> <strong>P (Publicness Overlay)</strong> active — amplification only, no new operator
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No evaluation of content, no intent attribution, no moral ranking. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>
			Large-scale online platform with quote-reply functionality and algorithmic amplification.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame anchor):</strong>
			Public social-media discourse frame where responses are visible, countable, and performative (likes, reposts, ratios).</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Rapid escalation within minutes; decay over 48–72 hours; long-term residue via searchability and screenshots.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (structural, not personal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: statement originator; becomes focal exposure node.</li>
			<li>Role R₂…Rₙ: responders; low individual exposure, high aggregate amplification.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ / ∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong>
			A statement is perceived as clumsy, inappropriate, or misaligned with prevailing expectations.</li>
			<li><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong>
			Immediate directional pressure to respond, signal stance, or align publicly.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Expected but mostly absent events (Λ candidates):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Requests for clarification.</li>
			<li>Targeted articulation of what would count as correction.</li>
			<li>Follow-up that connects reaction to accountable revision.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Quote-replies accumulate rapidly.</li>
			<li>Captions intensify in sharpness and rhetorical force.</li>
			<li>Very little address is made to a concrete correction path.</li>
			<li>After two days, attention shifts; reputational residue remains.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Readability Aid)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Δ (Difference – mismatch legible):</strong>
			“Statement vs. expected norm” becomes instantly nameable.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>∇ (Impulse – directional pressure):</strong>
			Strong push toward immediate expression.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame – discourse format):</strong>
			Platform structure privileges speed, visibility, and alignment signaling.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry – exposure gradient):</strong>
			One role absorbs concentrated exposure; many others incur minimal cost.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Attractor – repetition):</strong>
			Reposting and captioning stabilize into an outrage script.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality – accumulation):</strong>
			Permanent record hardens effects beyond the episode’s active phase.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Dependency hygiene note:</strong>
			References to <strong>Χ (Distance)</strong> are reduced markers only. In PMS terms, <strong>Χ presupposes Φ (Recontextualization) and Θ (Temporality)</strong> within a <strong>□ (Frame)</strong> background; its absence here reflects structural cost and speed, not lack of capacity in principle.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Drift Classification</h3>
			<p><strong>Drift class:</strong> Reaction masquerading as critique</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal drift signature:</strong>
			<strong>Δ + ∇ present / Χ absent or prohibitively costly</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Observable drift markers (non-moral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Speed substitutes for interruption; expression collapses into impulse discharge.</li>
			<li>Public exposure escalates faster than any correction pathway can stabilize.</li>
			<li>Repetition amplifies signal without increasing actionability.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry):</strong>
			Exposure concentrates sharply on the focal role; responders externalize risk.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Screenshots, searchability, and narrative residue outlast active attention.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Script narrowing):</strong>
			Outrage becomes the default response template for similar future events.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Λ (Non-event load):</strong>
			Absence of correction-oriented engagement increases interpretive pressure without resolution.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following behaviors are <strong>structurally rational</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Responding immediately to avoid being perceived as complicit or silent.</li>
			<li>Escalating tone to remain visible within a fast-moving stream.</li>
			<li>Avoiding attempts at integration due to exposure and misinterpretation risk.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These follow from <strong>P-amplified Ω under Θ</strong>, not from lack of concern for correction.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>
			Dignity-in-practice collapses when exposure replaces coordination and interruption becomes indistinguishable from punishment.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>
			Critique pressure is redirected into public degradation without a viable path for revision or follow-up, regardless of content accuracy.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader Guard / Validity Gate</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that public critique is illegitimate,</li>
			<li>that outrage implies bad faith,</li>
			<li>that the original statement was right or wrong,</li>
			<li>that silence would be preferable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that high expressive intensity can coexist with absence of critique-in-strict-sense,</li>
			<li>that publicness amplifies drift sensitivity without changing operator grammar,</li>
			<li>that reaction can stabilize without ever becoming interruption.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Validity reminder:</strong>
			If this analysis itself is used to shame, pile on, or rank actors, it violates PMS validity conditions (<strong>Χ, reversibility, D</strong>) and ceases to be a PMS application.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>In this configuration, critique pressure is real, but interruption never stabilizes. Reaction moves too fast to become interruptible, and exposure costs make distance prohibitively expensive. Publicness amplifies impulse and repetition without supplying a correction path. What remains after attention fades is not integration or binding, but residue: a hardened association produced by <strong>Ω across Θ</strong>, not by deliberate judgment.</p>
			<p>Here, critique does not fail because people care too little.
			It mutates because speed and exposure substitute for stop-capability before interruption can form.</p>
