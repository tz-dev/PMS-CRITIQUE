## Example 4 — *Policy Without Follow-Up*

**(Integration Present, Self-Binding Missing)**

**Case label:** *Formal Synthesis vs. Missing Trajectory Ownership*
**Scale:** c) Institutional
**Overlay:** No publicness overlay (P inactive)
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No evaluation of policy quality, intent, or competence. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**
Organizational response following a documented failure.

* **□ (Frame anchor):**
  Institutional policy-making frame: drafting, approval, publication, training.

* **Θ (Temporality):**
  Initial response phase followed by months of operational time without checkpoints.

* **Roles (structural, not personal):**

  * Role R₁: policy authors / approvers.
  * Role R₂: implementers subject to the guideline.
  * No role explicitly bound to longitudinal ownership.

**Trigger (Δ / ∇):**

* **Δ (Difference):**
  Gap between intended standards and observed failure becomes legible.
* **∇ (Impulse):**
  Pressure to demonstrate resolution through formal articulation.

**Expected but missing events (Λ candidates):**

* Scheduled review or audit.
* Feedback loop tied to observed practice.
* Assignment of responsibility across time.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* A coherent guideline is produced and communicated.
* Initial attention and training occur.
* No follow-up mechanisms materialize.
* Over time, reference to the policy becomes ritualized.

### B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Readability Aid)

* **Σ (Integration – synthesis achieved):**
  The guideline coherently integrates multiple concerns into a single statement.

* **Ψ (Self-Binding – weak or absent):**
  No durable commitment structure binds roles to the guideline across time.

* **Θ (Temporality – unowned trajectory):**
  Without time-bound checkpoints, the policy drifts out of operational relevance.

* **Λ (Non-Event – meaningful absence):**
  The lack of follow-up becomes informative: “nothing happens after publication.”

* **Α (Attractor – script stabilization):**
  “We have a policy” stabilizes as the default response to recurrence.

**Dependency hygiene note:**
No standalone claims about responsibility or maturity are made. Absence of **Ψ** here names missing structural binding, not motivational failure.

---

### C. Drift Classification

**Drift class:** Symbolic integration drift

**Minimal drift signature:**
**Σ present / Ψ absent**

**Observable drift markers (non-moral):**

* Statement exists without time-indexed ownership.
* Reference to the policy substitutes for enacted correction.

---

### D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects)

* **Θ (Temporality):**
  Each unreviewed month increases the gap between policy and practice.

* **Α (Script narrowing):**
  Policy production becomes the recognized endpoint of response.

* **Ω (Asymmetry):**
  Implementation burden diffuses downward, while binding authority remains unlocated.

* **Λ (Non-event load):**
  Absence of follow-up signals low consequence for non-alignment.

---

### E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Within this configuration, the following behaviors are **structurally rational**:

* Treating the guideline as symbolic rather than operative.
* Referencing policy existence to close discussions.
* Delaying alignment because no temporal enforcement signal appears.

These responses follow from **Σ without Ψ across Θ**, not from disregard or resistance.

---

### F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)

**Risk point:**
Dignity-in-practice is strained when responsibility is implied but never structurally owned, shifting exposure without binding protection.

**Structural indicator:**
The system avoids coercion but also avoids commitment, leaving enactment unsupported.

---

### G. Reader Guard / Validity Gate

This example **does not claim**:

* that policies are ineffective,
* that authors acted insincerely,
* that enforcement is morally required,
* that failure implies incompetence.

It **does claim**:

* that integration without self-binding does not generate durable change,
* that time requires ownership to remain corrective,
* that policy can stabilize as symbol when follow-up is structurally absent.

Any use of this analysis for blame or prescription violates PMS validity conditions (**Χ, reversibility, D**).

---

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

In this configuration, critique reaches synthesis but not commitment. Integration produces a clear statement, yet without self-binding it does not become a trajectory. Over time, absence of follow-up teaches the organization how seriously the policy is meant to be taken. What persists is not confusion, but a stable symbolic equilibrium: the guideline exists, the failure recurs, and reference replaces responsibility. The drift stabilizes where **Σ is decoupled from Ψ across Θ**, allowing coherence without consequence.
