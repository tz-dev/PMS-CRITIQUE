			<h2>Example 1 — <em>The Missing Reply Becomes the Story</em></h2>
			<p><strong>(Non-Event Load → Silence Attractor)</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Deferred Response vs. Stabilized Non-Intervention</em>
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no moral ranking, no attribution of intent. PMS application remains valid only under <strong>Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>
			Small team, recurring coordination meetings.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame anchor):</strong>
			Formal team meeting with an explicit escalation path: issues raised → manager follow-up → later review.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			Repeated meetings across several weeks; no single rupture, but cumulative delay.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Roles (structural, not personal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role R₁: raises safety-related concern; bears exposure if escalation fails.</li>
			<li>Role R₂: receives concern; controls follow-up channel; lower exposure to silence.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ / ∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong>
			Mismatch between stated safety concern and current practice becomes explicit.</li>
			<li><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong>
			Directional pressure toward correction (“this should be addressed”).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Expected but missing events (Λ candidates):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A reply, update, or explicit deferral.</li>
			<li>A reframing of priority or scope.</li>
			<li>Closure that would reset expectations.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (descriptive):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Manager says “send it to me.”</li>
			<li>No response follows for two weeks.</li>
			<li>Issue is not reintroduced in the next meeting.</li>
			<li>A joke later references futility (“nothing changes”).</li>
			<li>Over time, concerns stop being raised.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Not a Proof Chain)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Δ (Difference – mismatch legible):</strong>
			“Safety concern vs. current practice” is clearly nameable.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame – role space):</strong>
			Meeting structure defines what would count as an appropriate response.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Λ (Non-Event – structured absence):</strong>
			The promised follow-up does not occur; the absence itself becomes meaningful.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Attractor – stabilized repetition):</strong>
			Repeated non-response hardens into a script: “raising concerns goes nowhere.”</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry – exposure gradient):</strong>
			Raising issues concentrates risk on R₁; silence is cheaper for R₂.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality – accumulation):</strong>
			Each missed follow-up increases irreversibility and lowers the likelihood of renewed interruption.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Dependency hygiene note:</strong>
			References to <strong>Χ (Distance)</strong> in this example are implicit and reduced. In PMS terms, distance presupposes <strong>Φ (Recontextualization)</strong> and <strong>Θ (Temporality)</strong> within a <strong>□ (Frame)</strong> background; its erosion here reflects cost, not absence of capacity in principle.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Drift Trace (Structural, Neutral)</h3>
			<p><code>Λ (missed response) → Α (non-intervention script) → Ω (risk concentration) → Θ (irreversibility)</code></p>
			<p><strong>Key mutation:</strong>
			Silence stops being a temporary gap and becomes the dominant coordination mode.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects, Not Fault)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Interpretive costs:</strong>
			Team members must infer meaning from absence.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Exposure costs:</strong>
			Speaking up becomes increasingly risky relative to staying silent.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Temporal costs:</strong>
			Reopening the issue later appears disproportionate or disruptive.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Coordination costs:</strong>
			Safety concerns are displaced rather than resolved.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following behaviors are <strong>structurally rational</strong> (not morally preferred):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choosing not to re-raise the issue to avoid exposure.</li>
			<li>Using humor to acknowledge futility without escalating.</li>
			<li>Interpreting silence as implicit closure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These follow from <strong>Ω under Θ</strong>, not from indifference or lack of awareness.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>
			Dignity-in-practice erodes not through overt suppression, but through <em>procedural opacity</em>: nothing forbids speaking, yet speaking reliably incurs cost.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>
			Restraint exists formally, but enacted coordination privileges silence over protection of those exposed by raising concerns.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that silence implies malice or incompetence,</li>
			<li>that the manager acted in bad faith,</li>
			<li>that teams “should” escalate differently,</li>
			<li>that safety concerns were objectively valid or invalid.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that <strong>Λ (Non-Event)</strong> can carry coordinating force,</li>
			<li>that repetition converts absence into structure (<strong>Α</strong>),</li>
			<li>that silence can become an attractor without explicit decisions.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)</h3>
			<p>This analysis remains PMS-valid <strong>only if</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>interpretations stay scene-bound and revisable,</li>
			<li><strong>Χ (Distance)</strong> is not collapsed into judgment or blame,</li>
			<li><strong>D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong> blocks shaming or ranking,</li>
			<li>no binding is imposed on others (<strong>Ψ→Other</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Otherwise, the example is descriptive only.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>I. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>In this configuration, critique does not disappear—it is displaced.
			Once non-response stabilizes, <strong>absence (Λ)</strong> begins to coordinate more strongly than speech. Over time, <strong>temporality (Θ)</strong> and <strong>asymmetry (Ω)</strong> do the work that interruption would have done earlier. What looks like apathy is structurally a silence attractor: raising concerns becomes costlier than letting them go, without ever being prohibited.</p>
			<p>The outcome is not produced by intent or failure of care, but by the predictable consolidation of non-events into coordination.</p>
