			<h2><em>Example 5: Role Asymmetry Turns “Feedback” Into Exposure</em></h2>
		</header>
		<section id="content">
			<p><strong>Case label:</strong> <em>Evaluative Correction Without Coordination</em>
			<strong>Scale:</strong> b–c) Small group / institutional training setting
			<strong>Overlay:</strong> No publicness overlay (P inactive; exposure is local but role-amplified)
			<strong>Scope discipline:</strong> Structural mapping only. No claims about intent, competence, or character. PMS application validity remains conditional on <strong>Χ (Distance) + reversibility + D (Dignity-in-Practice)</strong>.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)</h3>
			<p><strong>Scene ID:</strong>
			Live training or evaluation session with hierarchical role differentiation.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame anchor):</strong>
			Training / evaluation frame: correction is expected, authority to speak is asymmetrically assigned.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry):</strong>
			Senior role bears low exposure cost; junior role bears high reputational and participation cost.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			The episode leaves residue: memory, reputation, and anticipatory self-restraint in later sessions.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Trigger (Δ / ∇):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Δ (Difference):</strong>
			A deviation from an expected standard becomes visible.</li>
			<li><strong>∇ (Impulse):</strong>
			Pressure to correct immediately and publicly within the evaluative frame.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Non-event candidates (Λ):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Private or delayed correction.</li>
			<li>Specification of a concrete corrective step.</li>
			<li>Explicit closure that restores participation safety.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Observed realizations (neutral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Correction is delivered publicly.</li>
			<li>Language generalizes (“this kind of mistake,” “you need to be more careful”).</li>
			<li>No actionable next step is integrated beyond evaluative labeling.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>B. Operator Mapping (Reduced Signature, Readability Aid)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>□ (Frame – evaluative):</strong>
			Defines correction as assessment rather than coordination.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry – exposure gradient):</strong>
			Visibility and cost concentrate on the junior role.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Δ (Difference – legible mismatch):</strong>
			A real deviation from standard exists and is named.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Σ (Integration – absent):</strong>
			No coherent corrective action is synthesized.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality – reputational persistence):</strong>
			The event narrows future participation through remembered exposure.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Attractor – script stabilization):</strong>
			“Do not ask / do not risk” stabilizes as a participation script.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>C. Drift Classification</h3>
			<p><strong>Drift class:</strong> Judgment masquerading as critique</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal drift signature:</strong>
			<strong>Δ present + □ evaluative + Ω high / Σ absent</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Observable drift markers (non-moral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Evaluation substitutes for coordination.</li>
			<li>Exposure rises while actionability collapses.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>D. Cost Distribution (Structural Effects)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Ω (Asymmetry):</strong>
			The cost of being wrong is borne unevenly; silence becomes cheaper than participation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Θ (Temporality):</strong>
			A single episode influences future behavior through anticipatory restraint.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Α (Script narrowing):</strong>
			Reduced questioning and experimentation normalize over time.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Λ (Non-event load):</strong>
			Absence of repair or follow-up signals that exposure is the default consequence.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h3>E. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)</h3>
			<p>Within this configuration, the following responses are <strong>structurally rational</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Increased risk-avoidance by the junior role.</li>
			<li>Reduced question-asking by peers who observe exposure costs.</li>
			<li>Compliance without engagement, as participation becomes hazardous.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These responses follow from <strong>Ω across Θ with missing Σ</strong>, not from lack of motivation or resilience.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>F. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Risk point:</strong>
			Dignity-in-practice is strained when correction increases exposure without restoring agency.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural indicator:</strong>
			The frame permits correction but does not protect recoverability or participation safety.</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>G. Reader Guard / Validity Gate</h3>
			<p>This example <strong>does not claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that public feedback is inherently wrong,</li>
			<li>that hierarchy is illegitimate,</li>
			<li>that the senior acted maliciously,</li>
			<li>that the mistake should not be addressed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It <strong>does claim</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>that critique mutates into judgment when exposure dominates coordination,</li>
			<li>that integration is required for correction to remain viable,</li>
			<li>that asymmetry shapes participation independently of intent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Any use of this example for shaming, ranking, or instruction violates PMS validity conditions (<strong>Χ, reversibility, D</strong>).</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)</h3>
			<p>In this configuration, critique fails not because a standard is named, but because correction is not integrated. The evaluative frame amplifies asymmetry, converting difference into exposure rather than coordination. Over time, participation adapts rationally: silence and risk-avoidance become stable responses. The drift stabilizes where <strong>Ω overwhelms Σ across Θ</strong>, allowing judgment to masquerade as critique without producing correction.</p>
